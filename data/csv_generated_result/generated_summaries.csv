0,"The Jordanian air force pilot filmed being burned to death by Islamic State extremists was heavily sedated and unaware of what was about to happen, it has been claimed. A report in Saudi Arabia's burnews.com claims ISIS militants admitted giving Moaz al-Kasasbeh drugs so that he did not scream as flames consumed his body during his grotesque execution. Jordan has struck back hard following the circulation of the video last week, hitting the militant group's territory with 56 air strikes in three days and executing two ISIS-linked prisoners. Drugged? A report in Saudi media claims Islamic State militants drugged Jordanian fighter pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh before filming the video that shows him being locked in a cage and burned alive . Little pain: The report also cites unspecified observers who said that Kasasbeh's 'sensory centres' burned away quickly, sparing him the agony of the inferno as it consumed him . Brutal: Titled 'Healing the Believers' Chests', the 22-minute film posted last week showed the captured airman locked in a cage before a trail of petrol leading up to its bars is set alight by masked Islamic State militants . Burnews.com reports that Kasasbeh's apparent resignation to his fate, as well as his apparently heroic stoicism as his petrol-soaked jumpsuit burst into flames, was due to heavy sedation. The report also cites  unspecified 'observers' it says conducted a detailed study of the video, who concluded that that Kasasbeh's 'sensory centres' burned quickly, leaving him unable to feel the pain of the inferno. 'It is important to note that [Kasasbeh] seemed unconscious and unaware of what awaits him and not, as some have said, that he is not afraid,' the site quotes these observers as saying. Titled 'Healing the Believers' Chests', the 22-minute film posted last week showed the captured airman locked in a cage before a trail of petrol leading up to its bars is set alight. Officials believe Kasasbeh had been killed almost one month earlier, despite ISIS attempting to carry out a prisoner exchange in return for the captured pilot. Martyr: Kasasbeh was downed over Raqqa, the Islamic State's de facto capital in Syria, and held for almost a month. Right, his wife Anwar Tarawneh, holds a photo of him before his grotesque execution was confirmed . Nation in mourning: Queen Rania of Jordan consoles Miss Tarawneh after the video showing her husband being burned to death was released by militants from Islamic State last week . After the footage was released, Jordanian officials promised to retaliate harshly and quickly executed two Iraqi militants connected with ISIS. This included Sajida al-Rishawi, the female would-be suicide bomber whose freedom ISIS had originally demanded in exchange for releasing Kasasbeh. King Abdullah II later said Jordan's response would 'be harsh because this terrorist organisation is not only fighting us, but also fighting Islam and its pure values.' In a statement, he pledged to hit the militants 'hard in the very centre of their strongholds'. The United States and several Arab allies, including Jordan, have been striking ISIS in Syria since September 23, after the militant group seized control of large areas of Iraq and Syria last year and declared a 'caliphate'. Warplanes from the U.S. and other countries have been waging an air campaign against the extremists in Iraq for even longer.","Report in Saudi media claims Islamic State militants gave Moaz al-Kasasbeh drugs so that he did not scream as flames consumed his body.

1,"Apple iPhone 4S: The smartphone's Safari browser is the most popular mobile web browser - Google is alleged to have bypassed privacy features built into the browser . Google and Facebook may have used a computer 'trick' that allows them to . monitor web browsing via Apple's Safari browser to build up advertising 'profiles' - circumventing Apple's . safety measures. The search giant bypassed privacy settings built into Apple's Safari web browser on iPhones,  PCs and Macs, according to a recent report. Other advertising companies, and Facebook, reportedly used a similar method. Safari is the most popular mobile web browser, used in all models of Apple's iPhone and iPad. Google allegedly circumvented the protection to build up profiles of web users, using a 'cookie' that collected advertising information. The move has caused outcry among privacy advocates. It comes shortly after EU privacy groups wrote to the search giant to ask it to 'halt' a new privacy policy that would allow it to 'share' customer data between services such as Search, Gmail and YouTube. Google allegedly used a 'trick' which sends a blank message to the browser to make it accept unauthorised 'cookies'. Apple says it is 'working to put a stop' to the practice. The code was uncovered by a Stanford University researcher Jonathan Mayer and was reported in the Wall Street Journal. Google has since disabled the code, and claims that the report is in error, and that its cookies only collected anonymous information. The revelation caused outcry among online privacy advocates. San Francisco's Electronic Frontier Foundation says, 'Coming on the heels of Google's controversial decision to tear down the privacy-protective walls between some of its other services, this is bad news for the company. 'It's time for Google to acknowledge that it can do a better job of respecting the privacy of Web users.' Google says that the report was in error. 'The Journal mischaracterizes what happened and why,' says a spokesperson. 'We used known Safari functionality to provide features that signed-in Google users had enabled. It’s important to stress that these advertising cookies do not collect personal information.' Under fire: Google is accused of 'bypassing' Apple's privacy protection to gather advertising information . 'Unlike other major browsers, Apple’s Safari browser blocks third-party cookies by default,' says the spokesperson. 'However, Safari enables many web features for its users that rely on third parties and third-party cookies, such as 'Like' buttons.  Last year, we began using this functionality to enable features for signed-in Google users on Safari.'To enable these features, we created a temporary communication link between Safari browsers and Google’s servers, so that we could ascertain whether Safari users were also signed into Google, and had opted for this type of personalization.''However, the Safari browser contained functionality that then enabled other Google advertising cookies to be set on the browser.  We didn’t anticipate that this would happen, and we have now started removing these advertising cookies from Safari browsers. European regulators recently wrote to . Google CEO Larry Page calling on the search giant to halt the . introduction of its new 'one-size-fits-all' privacy policy . The . policy was due to come into effect on March 1, and would allow Google . to share what it knows about users between services such as Google . Search, Gmail and YouTube. The . move horrified privacy advocates and bloggers - tech site ZDNet said . that Google would 'know more about you than your wife does' and said the . policy was 'Big Brother-ish'. The European Union working party asked for Google to stop the new policy while the working group investigate whether personal data is protected. ‘We call for a pause to ensure that there can be no misunderstanding about . Google’s commitments to information rights of EU . citizens.’ ‘Given the wide range of services you . offer, and the popularity of these services, changes in your privacy . policy may affect many citizens in most  EU member states,’ the group wrote to Google Chief Executive Larry Page.","Google allegedly used a 'trick' to monitor web browsing via Safari browser.

2,"A woman who claims she had a 'drunken fumble' with Prince Harry at his now-infamous naked party in Las Vegas can today be revealed as a dominatrix who charges $1,000 an hour for BDSM sessions. British-born Carrie Reichert, 40, offers kinky fun as a dominatrix under the name Lady Dominique and bills herself as a 'mistress of pain'. Her sordid secret was revealed after the Daily Mail Online obtained X-rated videos of Reichert – who is also a pole-dancer going by the name Carrie Royale – spanking and whipping a man during a wild session. Scroll down for video . 'Mistriss of pain': British-born Carrie Reichert offers kinky fun as a dominatrix under the name Lady Dominique. She is the only woman to come forward to claim that she partied with Prince Harry in Vegas. Prince Harry, pictured above in Las Vegas in 2012, was said to have invited 10 women to party with him at his VIP suite at the Encore at Wynn hotel, including Miss Reichert . Dressed in raunchy bondage gear, Reichert likes to belittle and humiliate her clients – earning up to $5,000 a time. In the video she wears a black PVC basque, knee-high boots and circles a bound, naked, masked man as he pants and cowers on the floor. She tells the whimpering man, 'You're so pathetic' before spanking him with a black paddle whip. Reichert claims she kissed a naked Prince Harry in a 20-minute 'drunken fumble' at his penthouse hotel room during the famous Las Vegas party in August 2012. She said in a newspaper interview at the time: 'We kissed, he was naked at the time, and pretty open. It was a drunken fumble. It wasn't romantic, just fun. 'He was a gentleman, but he was so wasted. The alcohol affected him. I was there for 15 to 20 minutes.' Now it can be revealed that the blonde charges $5,000 to $10,000 dollars for private BDSM sessions in her New Orleans apartment. A source said: 'Carrie [who also uses the code name Ms X] has a dungeon in a room at her place with big bed restraints and a St Andrew's cross which she ties men to and whips them. 'She also has Christian Grey-style racks with all her instruments and sex toys laid out on them - like paddles, nipple clamps and cat-of-nine-tail whips. Busted: The bedraggled 'party girl' Carrie Reichert posing for a jail booking photo. The 40-year-old, was arrested on check fraud charges and jailed in Mississippi earlier this year . 'She charges $1,000 for appearances at parties and for private sessions she can earn as much as $5,000 depending on how extreme the client wants to go. 'Recently she filmed a series of X-rated DVDs for her private clients. 'Rarely does she have sex with clients - she's had some really strange people so far but she enjoys it.' Earlier this year, Reichert performed a striptease show in which she used underpants she claimed belonged to Prince Harry. The routine – which she performed at the Harry Mohney Erotic Heritage Museum in Las Vegas in January – involved her taking off the outfit she wore on the night she allegedly met the young royal before twirling the underpants she claims he gifted to her. Reichert, who lied that she was 32 when she spoke about the royal party in 2012, claims she has now donated the underpants, along with a string bikini she wore, to the museum. Kensington Palace has previously denied Reichert was one of 10 women invited back to the Prince's VIP suite at the Encore at Wynn hotel and dismissed her story as 'untrue'. Reichert is the only woman to have ever spoken out about the prince's wild night. She claims she was hand picked by a member of the royal entourage as she hung out by the pool at the Encore and invited to the Prince's penthouse suite. British-born Reichert, 40, says she performed a routine involving her taking off the outfit she wore on the night she met the prince and will twirl his undergarments . The dominatrix previously told how Prince Harry was already naked when she entered the room and was playing air guitar with a pool cue and giving 'random naked hugs'. Among other shocking claims she made at the time, the pole dancer said that high-spirited Harry pressed his naked body up against the giant window of his suite and declared: 'Look at me, Vegas, these are the royal jewels.' Later, the prince was photographed on a cell phone wearing nothing but a necklace while a naked female guest hid behind him during a game of strip pool. Another photo showed him giving the same topless woman a naked bear hug. The photos - which have since been seen by tens of millions across the world – caused acute embarrassment for the royal family as well as raising security fears about how well the prince was protected on his Vegas trip. Just weeks after the party, Reichert spent a month in Harrison County Jail in Mississippi after being arrested for a $22,000 check fraud.","Carrie Reichert, 40, offers kinky fun as a dominatrix under the name Lady Dominique.

3,"Menace: The Tineola bisselliella moth  has infected the Olympic village . They came in the dead of night, attracted by a blaze of light so vast it could be seen from miles away. To an inquisitive moth, the Olympic village must have looked like paradise - 9,000 brand new wardrobes, each containing enough clothing to see athletes through two weeks of the Games. Or, to put it another way, a fortnight of prime packed lunches for Tineola bisselliella and its pesky cousin pellionella. For the Olympic park is at the centre of an area infested with fabric-chomping moths - and Stratford was pinpointed yesterday as one of the worst hit areas in the UK. Don't even dare to imagine what might happen should they chance to munch on the women's beach volleyball bikinis. Perish the thought that British athletes will parade proudly in uniforms that invite critics to describe our opening ceremony as moth-eaten. And forget the fact that so much unpalatable Lycra and man-made 'performance fibres' will deter the larvae of the common clothes moth (bisselliella) or the case-bearing clothes moth (pellionella). With this many people concentrated into such a small area, there is enough grub here for a plague of biblical proportions. The revelation that the Olympic stadium's recently assigned E20 postcode is a hot-spot for moth invasion came from anti-moth and homecare company Caraselledirect. It monitors pest control sales daily . to determine which areas are most affected. On a moth map of the UK, . Stratford is plotted at the epicentre of what it described as an . escalating 'epidemic'. Figures . suggest the problem is 40 times bigger than in Newcastle upon Tyne, for . example; nearly 400 times worse than in Belfast; and greater than in . the whole of Scotland. On the menu? Members of Team GB model their  Olympic kit as they arrive at the Olympic Village yesterday . Rich pickings: The Olympic village has  9,000 brand new wardrobes, each containing enough clothing to see athletes through two weeks of the Games . 'They show no respect for Savile Row suits, Primark jumpers or athletes' outfits,' said the firms moth expert, Jonathan Beriland. 'Anything they can get their teeth into - jackets, trousers, underpants - will become a casualty.' London and the south east saw a big increase in moth populations recently because of unseasonal or prolonged spells of cold, wet weather. That meant homes, offices (and flats in the Olympic village) kept windows closed and heat on - perfect conditions for moths to lay eggs that turn into cloth-eating larvae. Females can lay 40 eggs in three weeks, producing larvae which may carry on chomping for up to a year before pupating. No doubt granny would simply have shaken out the clothes and stocked up on pongy mothballs. Don't even think about it! Members of the Australian beach volleyball team during a training session at Horse Guards Parade yesterday . By . the time athletes notice any adult moths flying out of their wardrobes, . however, the seeds of sartorial disaster will already have been sown. Ironically, the Stratford stadium . boats that 'sustainable development' has provided new habitats for a . host of species, including the toadflax brocade moth, whose larvae spurn . athletics gear in favour of the plant from which it takes its name. But . even recently revamped security measures, plus surface to air missiles, . appear to not to have stopped the airborne cloth-destroyers . infiltrating. Olympic . officials said yesterday they had 'not been overwhelmed' by complaints . about masticated clothing, or by reports of munching sounds from inside . athletes' wardrobes (which, it is understood, have no moth protection). But one did report that an American athlete spent an uncomfortable night swatting moths after leaving his balcony doors open and dozing off with the light on. Finally, a terrifying thought. Just where did those big holes in the Olympic rings come from?","Olympic village has 9,000 brand new wardrobes, each containing enough clothing to see athletes through two weeks of the Games.

4,"The mother of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects is set to travel to the U.S. today with her ex-husband, nearly a week after one of their reign of terror came to an end. Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, who now lives in Dagestan, Russia, said in an emotional telephone interview that she believes her sons, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, have been framed for the bombings. The suspects' father, Anzor Tsarnaev, has already been interviewed by Russian and American authorities there - and will also travel to the U.S. to be interviewed by investigators. Speaking out on Wednesday, Mrs Tsarnaeva launched into a bizarre rant in . which she claims she does not care if she or her youngest son are killed . by U.S. authorities. Scroll down for video . Rant: Zubeirat Tsarnaena, the Boston bombers' mother, has said she does not care if her surviving son is killed . Their eldest son, Tamerlan, 26, died . after a shootout with police in Watertown, Massachusetts on Friday, . while her youngest, Dzhokhar, 19, is in hospital recovering from a bullet wound . to the neck. 'If they are going to kill him, I don't . care,' she told CNN of Dzhokhar. 'My oldest one is killed, so I don't care. I don't care is my . youngest one is going to be killed today. I want the world to hear this. And I don't care if I am going to get killed too. And I will say . Allahu akbar!' While Dzhokhar was reportedly injured from a self-inflicted gun shot wound as he sought to hide from police in a boat parked in a backyard, his mother said she does not believe this account. 'You know what I think? I think now they . will try to make my Dzhokhar guilty because they took away his voice, . his ability to talk to the world... They did not want the truth to come . out,' she said. She added that the only reason her sons were targeted was because they were Muslim, adding that she saw footage of Tamerlan being killed 'really cruelly.' U.S. authorities are on their way to speak with Zubeidat Tsarnaeva in the aftermath of the bombings. Suspects: Dzhokhar, right, and Tamerlan Tsarnaev are accused of planting the Boston bombs at the historic race on April 15 . Investigators traveled to southern Russia on Tuesday to speak to Mrs Tsarnaeva and her husband Anzor, an American Embassy official said. But if she returns to the U.S. to see . her son - as she reportedly intends to as early as Thursday - she could . be arrested, thanks to an outstanding shoplifting charge. Busted: Mrs Tsarnaeva, 45, was arrested last year after she allegedly stole $1,600 worth of clothing from a Massachusetts Lord & Taylor store . ABC News reported on Tuesday that Mrs Tsarnaeva failed to show up at a court hearing stemming from a July 2012 arrest. So if she returns to the U.S. to visit her hospitalized son or make burial arrangements for the other, she . could be arrested on an outstanding warrant. Mrs Tsarnaeva, 45, allegedly stole $1,600 worth of clothes from a Massachusetts Lord & Taylor store. She was charged with two . counts of malicious/wanton damage and defacement to property after . allegedly swiping the merchandise from the retailer's Natick, . Massachusetts location in June 2012. She was due in court on October 25 for a hearing in the case, but never showed up. The Lord & Taylor location is . not the same as the one on Boyleston Street in Boston, where a . surveillance camera captured what police say is her younger son . dropping a pressure cooker bomb that was hidden inside a backpack. The family's lawyer Heda Saratova, asked for the family to be left alone and said that the parents had just seen . pictures of the body of their elder son and were not up to . speaking with anyone. Questioning: Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, mother of Boston bombing suspects Tamerlan and Dzhokhar, leaves her home for the first time on Tuesday in Dagestan with an unidentified man . Grief: Zubeidat Tsarnaeva is pictured outside her home in Dagestan, a predominantly Muslim province in Russia's Caucasus . 'The mother is in very bad shape,' Saratova said. 'She watches the video and cries.' The images, taken by a resident of Watertown, Massachusetts and posted on his blog, appear to show the Tsarnaev . brothers sheltering behind a vehicle and taking aim at police . officers. They are reportedly seen running to a car for more supplies before . hauling out a pressure cooker bomb they then detonated, filling the . street with smoke. The photographs, taken on the . eyewitness' phone from a third-floor bedroom overlooking the . scene, are the first images giving insight into the fraught battle that . left one brother dead. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev then jumped in the car . and barreled towards the police barricade, making a narrow escape. Authorities said that he ran over his brother Tamerlan. Dad: U.S. investigators traveled to southern Russia on Tuesday to speak to Mrs Tsarnaeva and the brothers' father Anzor, pictured, an American Embassy official said . Their mother told Channel 4 on Tuesday that her sons had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks. She said: 'What happened is a terrible thing but I know my kids have nothing to do with this. I know it, I am mother.' She added to CNN that she had spoken . to Tamerlan after the bombings and he told her he missed her and loved . her, and she said her 'loving' son even inquired about the cat. The trip by the U.S. team was made . possible because of Russian government cooperation with the FBI . investigation into the bombing at the Boston Marathon. Also on Tuesday, the bombers' sister, . Ailena and Bella Tsarnaev, released a statement to the media, saying . that they 'don't have the answers' about their brothers' alleged crimes. Battle: The eyewitness said the men ran to the green sedan, left, for more supplies such as explosives . Threat: In another image, a red circle shows what the eyewitness believed to be a pressure cooker bomb . Taken down: Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a gunfight with police on April 19. Dzhokhar, who was injured, was captured that evening . The statement read: 'Our heart goes . out the victims of last week's bombing. It saddens us to see so many . innocent people hurt after such a callous act. 'As a family, we are absolutely devastated by the sense of loss and sorrow this has caused. 'We . don't have any answers but we look forward to a thorough investigation . and hope to learn more. We ask the media to respect our privacy during . this difficult time.' The mother is from Dagestan, while the suspects' father is from neighboring Chechnya. Their . sons had spent little time in either place before the family moved to . the U.S. a decade ago, but the elder son was in Russia for six months . last year. Shielded: Katherine Russell, the widow of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, leaves her lawyer's office on Tuesday . The father of the two Boston bombing suspects will apparently travel to the U.S. later this week in order to seek 'justice and the truth'.

5,"An NHS clinic is treating transgender children as young as 12 with drug therapies to prepare them for a sex change, it has been revealed. More than 20 youngsters with 'gender dysphoria' are being prescribed hormone blockers by doctors at the Tavistock Clinic in north London. The treatment halts the onset of puberty - preventing children from developing the sexual characteristics of the gender they were born. Controversial: The Tavistock Clinic in north London is prescribing hormone blockers to children as young as 12 . The clinic started offering the medication in 2011 as part of a study to determine whether transgender children could benefit from starting treatment earlier than in the past, according to The Sunday Times. It was initially deemed controversial due to the patients' ages - with critics arguing that the youngsters lacked the ability to consent to the therapies. However, since then, the clinic has received a staggering 142 referrals of children aged 11 to 15 from parents and carers. Dr Polly Carmichael, director of the Tavistock Clinic's gender identity service, said she plans to continue offering the treatment to youngsters after the study culminates in April. Fight: Transgender Leo Waddell, 12,  was born as a girl called Lily, right. Last month, he vowed to fight a doctor's decision to ban him from taking hormone blockers, which halt the onset of puberty . 'Thirty-five [children] so far have been accepted into the early intervention study, about half of these born as girls and half as boys, of whom 23 are already being treated with hormone blockers,' she told The Sunday Times. 'Another 12 have gone forward but are not yet in treatment, perhaps because they are still too early in puberty.' Once they have reached 16 years old, children are given two options: To halt the hormone blockers - causing them to stay the same gender - or to take 'cross-sex' hormones, which change their body to the opposite gender. At the age of 18, the Tavistock Clinic is able to refer them for a sex change operation. Upset: Speaking on This Morning last month, Leo  - pictured with his mother, Hayley, 48 - said he started to cry when he was told he couldn't undergo hormone therapy . The clinic's approach is a sharp . contrast to most doctors' surgeries in the UK, where children under 16 . years old are generally refused hormone blockers. However, pro-treatment campaigners argue that, by their 16th birthday, most youngsters have experienced the onset of puberty - making it harder for them to change gender.. Dr Carmichael said it was 'better' for children not to have gone through puberty before 'transitioning'. But she added: 'You are asking someone aged as young as 11 to make big decisions about their adult life and identity. We have to be very careful to keep options open.' Beauty Queen: Miss England finalist Jackie Green became the youngest person in the world to undergo transgender surgery . Last month, 12-year-old transgender Leo Waddell vowed to fight a doctor's decision to ban him from taking hormone blockers. Leo,  from Lowestoft, Suffolk, was born as a girl called Lily but has lived as a boy since the age of five. He plans to take testosterone at the age of 16, before undergoing gender reassignment surgery at the age of 18. In the meantime, he wants to take hormone . blockers to prevent the onset of puberty and the release of female . hormones in his body. However, despite undergoing numerous psychological and hormone tests, his GP has refused to prescribe them because . she was unsure of the long-term effects - adding: 'Any clinical decision I make always gives consideration to every aspect of the patient's wellbeing'. Speaking on This Morning with his mother, Hayley, 48, Leo said: 'I didn't like it, I started to cry when she told me.' Mrs Waddell added: 'What so many people don't understand is that I feel it's far more dangerous for Leo to not have these hormone blockers. 'The things he has to go though, the emotions and the torment is slowly bringing him down and down.' Leo is one of a growing number of British children with gender dysphoria, a . condition whereby you feel have been physically assigned the wrong . gender at birth. In 2009, aged 16, Jackie Green became the youngest person in the world to undergo transgender surgery - having travelled to America aged 12 to receive hormone blockers. Last year, as a 19-year-old woman, Jackie made history once again by becoming . the first transgender Miss England finalist. She later claimed she 'would have killed' herself if she hadn't been prescribed the blockers by a doctor in Boston.","More than 20 youngsters with 'gender dysphoria' are being prescribed hormone blockers by doctors at the Tavistock Clinic in north London.

6,"Bali Nine drug kingpin Andrew Chan, who is facing death by firing squad in Indonesia, masterminded another international heroin smuggling attempt out of Hong Kong - but the operation failed, resulting in three young Australians being jailed. Daily Mail Australia can reveal for the first time that Chan enlisted Sydney teenager Rachel Diaz, 17, and Chris Vo, 15, both from western Sydney, as drug couriers to smuggle $1 million worth of heroin in condoms, which they were to swallow in Hong Kong and bring back to Australia. The Hong Kong deal was to run at the same time as the Bali Nine operation - when Chan, Myuran Sumurakan and seven Australian mules were arrested, some with the drugs strapped to their bodies. It can also be revealed that after his own arrest, Chan wrote a letter to Diaz in Hong Kong, ordering her to keep her mouth shut. Scroll down for video . The Godfather: Andrew Chan was involved in three international drug smuggling operations when he was arrested in Bali . Drug mule: Rachel Diaz was hired by Bali Nine mastermind Andrew Chan who, following her arrest and incarceration in a Hong Kong prison, wrote her a letter ordering her to keep her mouth shut . Hard to swallow: The 114 heroin-filled condoms which Rachel Diaz, 17, was supposed to  swallow when the trainee Sydney hairdresser was arrested in a seedy Hong Kong hotel room . Drug kings: One-time mail room worker Myuran Sukumaran (left, with Andrew Chan) says he became involved in the 8.3kg Bali importation to satisfy his lust for fast cars, glamorous women and and a life of nightclubbing . Chan and syndicate partner Sumurakan are on death row and were told this week by new Indonesian President Joko Widodo that he would not grant them pardons, despite their attempts to rehabilitate themselves behind bars. They could face death by firing squad in coming months. Chan, who Indonesian police called 'The Godfather'  when they arrested him, was a key organiser of the Australian end of the smuggling and distribution network, which was detailed in the Hong Kong court during Diaz's trial and described as a 'predatory crime syndicate'. In just two weeks in April 2005, the syndicate was responsible for the arrest, and later the incarceration, of 17 young Australians for heroin trafficking in three countries.

Frantic father: Coca Cola representative Ferdinand Diaz, pictured in Hong Kong, made several attempts to get his daughter (pictured during her school days) freed from prison . Diaz, Vo and their minder Hutchinson Tran, 22, were arrested in a low budget Hong Kong hotel room on April 12, 2005. They were found with 114 condoms filled with up to 1kg of heroin - but Diaz had had second thoughts about taking part in the operation, for which they were to be paid $200 for each 5cm-long condom they ingested. Diaz's father Ferdinand failed to get his daughter released on bail and 12 months after her arrest, she was sentenced to 10 years and eight months. Vo, by then 16, received nine years, and Tran got 13 years and four months. All have since been released, with Diaz serving out the majority of her sentence in a NSW women's prison after being transferred in February 2009 under the International Transfer of Prisoners' Act. Five days after her arrest, Bali police arrested Chan, Sukumaran and their mules Renae Lawrence, Martin Stephens, Scott Rush, Si Yi Chen, Matthew Norman, Michael Czugaj and Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen. The seven couriers recruited by Chan and Sukumaran have all received sentences ranging from 18 years to life.

Behind closed doors: Lured to this hotel  in Hong Kong's Tsim Sha Tsui district by a drug gang which preyed on young Australians, Diaz, 17, and Vo, 15, were arrested with 1kg of heroin in condoms . Both the Bali Nine and the Hong Kong drug smuggling deals were connected with a third, lesser-known attempted heroin importation in which Chan and Sukumaran conspired with four young Brisbane people. Daily Mail Australia can also reveal that in the lead up to the Bali Nine and the Hong Kong operations Chan and Sukumaran visited a young Korean-Australian who was later arrested and charged over the Hong Kong conspiracy following the arrest of Diaz, Vo and Tran. A Korean-Australian and a co-conspirator were charged with plotting to import the packages of heroin that Diaz and 15-year-old Vo were meant to swallow. The Bali Nine are a group of nine Australians who attempted to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from Bali to Australia on August 17, 2005. Drug mastermind Andrew Chan and his cohort, Myuran Sukumaran, recruited six men and one woman aged between 19 and 30 years old and strapped heroin to their bodies. Renae Lawrence, Martin Stephens, Scott Rush, Si Yi Chen, Matthew Norman Michael Czugaj and Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen were arrested in a hotel and at Denapasar airport and taken to Bali's Kerobokan prison. Lawrence was sentenced to 20 years, Rush's sentence has been redeuced to 18 years and the other five mules are serving life sentences. Chan and Sukumaran were given the death penalty and in early December 2014, Indonesia's new President Joko Widodo said the men would face execution by firing squad. With prison remission, Lawrence's current earliest possible release date is February 2026. Chan visited the Korean-Australian at least three times in different NSW prisons and once with Sukumaran in late 2004, just before the two made two 'practice' runs to Indonesia with several of the future Bali Nine couriers, including Renae Lawrence, and successfully returned to Australia with heroin strapped to their bodies. Chan, who was a manager at a Sydney catering company, duped three of his staff - Lawrence, Norman and Stephens - into becoming mules, promising them thousands of dollars in return. Following the arrests in Hong Kong and Bali within days of each other - and a series of other arrests in Sydney and Brisbane just days later - police said the Bali Nine had no connection with the Diaz case. However, detectives have exclusively revealed that Chan was in contact with Diaz for months and all three trafficking deals were connected to a Sydney-based Chinese drug smuggling syndicate which had links to Myanmar. Chan, who has found God in prison, was regularly visiting another convicted drug dealer in prison as he was conspiring to commit the Bali Nine deal. Diaz and Vo were recruited to go to Hong Kong as drug mules, police say, on the promise of $6000 or $7000 for a single trip. Diaz, a trainee hairdresser with churchgoing Filipino migrant parents, and Vo, a McDonald's worker and son of a single mother of Vietnamese origin, came from modest income families in western Sydney. Neither had previously known connections with drug syndicates, nor had they met before they flew out from Sydney to Hong Kong in April 2005. Diaz's parents, Ferdinand and Maria, believed she was having a sleep-over at a friend's house and then reported her missing when she failed to return. Squalor and misery: Australian inmates Si Yi Chen, Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen and Matthew Norman in a holding cell before a court appearance at Denpasar . Greedy fool: Myuran Sukumaran (pictured arriving at court to appeal his death sentence) admits his role in the Bali Nine drug deal just because he wanted an easy life with cars, money and women . On the day she and Vo were due home, April 13, police believe the Korean-Australian went to Sydney Airport to collect them, armed with three packets of laxatives. Diaz and Vo were in a room at the Imperial Hotel, in Hong Long's Tsim Sha Tsui backpacker district, with the 114 heroin-filled condoms, supplied by Hutchinson Tran, when police burst in. Vo was prepared to swallow 30 packages but Diaz had apparently reconsidered, realising they could burst inside her stomach during the eight-hour flight back to Sydney. Fearful place: Hong Kong's notorious Tai Lam correctional facility where Diaz was incarcerated before being  transferred to a Sydney prison . Firing squad: After a series of court appeals, Myuran Sukumaran (left) and Andrew Chan are the sole remaining members of the Bali Nine who still face death by an Indonesian firing squad . Earliest possible release: With prison governor's remissions, Bali Nine drug smuggler Renae Lawrence  will be the first of the group to gain freedom, in February 2026 at the earliest . Meanwhile, four Australians from Brisbane - aged 24, 22, 18, and 19, had been arrested in Brisbane and charged with conspiring with Chan and Sukumaran of conspiring to import heroin to Australia. A fifth, Khanh Thanh Ly, 24, was arrested in Sydney. Ly subsequently pleaded guilty, but said he was only a 'runaround' in the gang whose members included Sukumaran, and was never paid but did it for the 'glamour' and entries to parties and clubs. The Bali Nine incident was linked to one of the world's biggest drug syndicates, Crescent Moon, which has smuggled large quantities of heroin from Myanmar (Burma) to Western countries. Chan has admitted he saw the Bali Nine deal as a 'quick pay day'. He has never spoken about his involvement in the Hong Kong deal. In an interview with ABC TV he pleaded for clemency, saying if his death sentence was commuted and he was released from prison, he wanted to help the community and become a minister of religion.","Andrew Chan, who is facing death by firing squad in Indonesia, masterminded another international heroin smuggling attempt out of Hong Kong.
The operation failed, resulting in three young Australians being jailed.
Daily Mail Australia can reveal for the first time that Chan enlisted Sydney teenager Rachel Diaz, 17, and Chris Vo, 15, both from western Sydney, as drug couriers to smuggle $1 million worth of heroin in condoms.
The Hong Kong deal was to run at the same time as the Bali Nine operation - when Chan, Myuran Sumurakan and seven Australian mules were arrested, some with the drugs strapped to their bodies.

7,"A woman has been sentenced to five years’ probation after being found guilty of first sexually assaulting and then having intercourse with her best friend's teenage son over a two year period starting when he was just aged 13. Karen Lee Carstens, 43, was convicted of sexual assault of a child by a jury in Houston, Texas, on Wednesday and was then sentenced on Thursday morning. Police said she began sexual assaulting the teen in 2007 when he was 13 years old and eventually ended up having a sex with him on numerous occasion at her home. Karen Lee Carstens, 43, has been sentenced to five years probation after being found guilty having sex with her best friend's teenage son . ‘I feel like she deserved everything that she got,’ the unnamed victim, now 19 years old, told KHOU. The improper relations had begun when Carstens volunteered to help babysit the teen while her friend, the boy's mother, was hospitalized. The boy described a couple of the encounters to investigators, particularly those which happened over a three-month period when his mother was in and out of the hospital due to a gallbladder infection. He said on May 15, 2009, he and Carstens were lying on a sofa bed and watching television when they started to have sex. The unnamed victim, now 19, told local TV news that he believed that Carstens had gotten what she deserved . According to court documents the boy 'cried believing he had impregnated [Carstens] but she assured him not to worry because her menstrual cycle was due soon.' The boy told investigators that when the relationship began it involved just touching her breasts and genitals, but progressed to oral sex. In the court documents, the boy described one encounter where he suggested anal sex as a way for them to avoid pregnancy. She at first refused but then allowed the teen to do it. The affair ended shortly after when Carstens moved to Riva, Maryland. The improper relations had begun when Carstens, pictured in court, had volunteered to help babysit the teen while her friend, the boy's mother, was hospitalized . Police say the victim said Carstens told him not to tell anyone about their sexual relationship because she could get into trouble. Authorities investigated and found enough evidence to file charges against Carstens. Her bail was set at $30,000.","Karen Lee Carstens, 43, was convicted of sexual assault of a child by a jury in Houston, Texas, on Wednesday.

8,"Exhausted, covered in mud and desperately hungry, a team of Swedish athletes sat down for a meal as they prepared to take on a dangerous 20-mile trek through the Ecuadorian rainforest. As they opened their canned meat, a tired Mikael Lindnord noticed a scruffy, miserable stray dog staring at him out of the corner of his eye. Feeling sorry for him, he fed the dog a meatball and thought nothing of it, but as the team stood up to continue their race the animal started to follow them - and he didn't stop. As the group of four navigated the final two stages of the 430-mile Adventure Racing World Championship, the dog befriended them and was eventually given the name Arthur. Every grueling task the team face, Arthur would do the same. He swam alongside them while they kayaked down rivers, dragged himself up hills during hikes and pulled through knee-deep mud during treks. Even when the team tried to get rid of their new member out of concerns for his safety - he refused to leave. Scroll down for video . The fifth member: Team Peak Performance walk with stray dog Arthur during a stage of the 430-mile Adventure Racing World Championship. He followed the group of four during the grueling race . All terrains: Despite numerous attempts by the team to get rid of the dog, primarily for his own safety, he refused to go. It meant when he got stuck in the knee-deep mud they helped get him out and when he was exhausted, they stopped to take a break . Encounter: Mikael Lindnord first noticed the scruffy dog when he was sitting down to eat canned meatballs. He fed Arthur one thinking nothing on it, but ended up creating a bond with the dog . This meant when he was tired they stopped for a break and when he got stuck in the mud they pulled him out. After six days the team finished the race, and the dog had suffered. They therefore decided to take him to a vet while still in South America to have him checked out. During that time Lindord thought to himself that after their experience, they could not leave Arthur, so he decided to adopt him and take him back to Sweden. He applied to the Jordbruksverket (the Swedish Board of Agriculture) and was made to wait to see if his application was successful. After a tense few days, the team arrived at the airport with Arthur and boarded the plane with him back home. Adventure Racing is a form of extreme sport that combines continuous hiking, trekking, mountain biking and kayaking over a successive number of days. The world championships held in Ecuador covered three diverse geographical regions - the Andes, the Pacific and the Amazon rainforest. Lindord told Swedish news site Aftonbladet: 'I had just opened a food pack when I saw a scruffy miserable dog in the corner of my eye. For more from Team Peak Performance click here . Determined: Before one of the segments of the race - a 36 mile kayak around the coast - organizers warned the team that taking Arthur along posed a risk to his and their safety. But Arthur swam alongside the boat and ended up being pulled in by Lindord . Grueling: The race takes teams of four around ten days, and involves continuous hiking, trekking, mountain biking and kayaking . Resting: When the team slept Arthur would also curl up and take a nap alongside them . Video Source Team Peak Performance . 'I thought he was hungry and gave him a meatball. Then I thought no more of it. He added: 'At one stage we had to take a break and the dog was totally wrecked. We opened two cans of food and let him eat, because he could find no food at all in the jungle.' Before one of the segments of the race - a 36 mile kayak around the coast - organizers warned the team that taking Arthur along posed a risk to his and their safety. They tried to set off without him, but as they left he jumped into the water beside them and started desperately paddling. Lindord, heartbroken by the site of Arthur struggling in the water, picked him up, put him in the kayak and let him stay for the rest of the journey. The gesture prompted a standing ovation and cheers from spectators watching from the banks. The ordeal to get him back to Sweden was documented on the team's Facebook page. In one post Lindord wrote: 'I almost cried in front of the computer, when receiving the decision from Jordbruksverket (Board of Agriculture) in Sweden!' 'The team is overwhelmed and happy knowing that Jordbruksverket has approved Mikaels application to bring Arthur to Sweden. A big important piece in the work to get Arhur on the plane, is done. So far so good. But, There are [sic] still one paper to go. The team are now working hard for the very last piece in this puzzel [sic]. Lindord ended by saying: 'I came to Ecuador to win the World Championship. Instead, I got a new friend.' Support: At one point the dog was not able to find any food in the jungle, so the team stopped and gave him some of their canned food . Challenge: As the team neared the finished the tasks began to take their toll on Arthur and he ended up with some injuries . Health checks: When the team finished the race, they took Arthur to Ecuador to see a vet in order to prepare him for the trip back to Sweden .

Emotional: When Lindord received news that the Board of Agriculture had approved his request for Arthur to be brought back to Sweden, he said he cried while looking at the computer . Happy: Despite his injuries and the toll the final two stages of the race had taken on him, Arthur began to look healthy as he prepared to fly to Sweden and settle into his new home .

9,"Bashar Al-Assad launched the chemical attack which killed hundreds of people because he 'lost his nerve' in a moment of panic and worried that Damascus would fall to rebel troops, according to new intelligence. In a telephone call which was tapped by German spy chiefs, a senior Hezbollah commander told the Iranian embassy in Lebanon that Syria's president intended to tilt the balance of power towards the regime in the battle for control of the country's capital. However, it appears that the chemical attack backfired, as it looks set to prompt a major intervention from American and French troops aimed at crippling Assad's military capabilities. Barack Obama today spoke out to demand that the world take action against Syria, saying that the international community 'cannot be silent' over the use of chemical weapons. Scroll down for video . Attack: Bashar Al-Assad is said to have launched a barrage of chemical weapons after he 'lost his nerve' Promise: Barack Obama said that the 'credibility' of the West was in question if it did not intervene . The German intelligence came as Vladimir Putin warned the West not to take unilateral action against Syria, and repeated his claim that the regime was not responsible for the chemical weapons strike in the suburbs of Damascus two weeks ago. Russia today announced that it is sending a missile cruiser to the eastern Mediterranean to enforce the country's interests in the volatile region. Pope Francis also entered the fray, attempting to slow the march to war by summoning ambassadors from all over the world. The call from a Hezbollah leader about the chemical attack, in which he described the move as 'a big mistake', was intercepted by Germany's BNC intelligence service and reported by Der Spiegel magazine. The revelation has led the country's top spies to agree with the U.S. intelligence assessment that Assad was indeed responsible for using chemical weapons in the attack on August 21. BND president Gerhard Schindler said that following a 'thorough analysis', the regime must have been the perpetrator, and the government is the only actor which possesses chemical agents such as sarin. Vote: Mr Obama, pictured with Sweden's prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, is facing a debate in Congress . Meeting: Mr Obama with his national security team at a breakfast summit with Swedish officials . The BND believes that the use of . sarin may have been meant as a deterrent against rebel forces, but that . the military used too much of it by mistake. 'The . new information from the BND could become important in the coming . days,' Der Spiegel said. 'Thus far the U.S. has only noted that after . the attack, intelligence agencies had intercepted internal government . communications indicating concern about a possible UN inspection of the . site. 'The telephone . conversation intercepted by the BND could be an important piece in the . puzzle currently being assembled by Western intelligence experts.' Despite . the findings, Germany is unlikely to join any military action by the . West after both Angela Merkel and her main election rival ruled out an . attack. Britain also . seems certain to stay away from the front line of any conflict after . David Cameron's Government was defeated in a vote in the House of . Commons last week. War: Children stand around in the rubble of a building apparently destroyed by Assad's forces . Strike: The West is expected to launch military attacks on Syria within the next few days . By contrast, Mr Obama is expected to win the support of the U.S. Congress after leading figures from both the Democratic and Republican parties came out in support of intervention. Speaking in Stockholm as he travelled to the G20 summit in St Petersburg, Mr Obama insisted that it was essential to strike against Assad over the chemical attacks. 'In the face of such barbarism the international community cannot be silent,' he said at a press conference. 'Failing to respond to this attack would only increase the risk of more attacks and that possibility that other countries would use these weapons, as well.' The President defended his decision to intervene once Assad crossed the 'red line' of using chemical weapons, saying that it was vital to uphold 'international norms'. Defiant: Vladimir Putin has warned the West against intervening in Syria and igniting a regional conflagration . 'That wasn't something I made up,' he said. 'I didn't pluck it out of thin air. There's a reason for it. 'The . international community's credibility is on the line. America and . Congress' credibility is on the line, because we give lip service to the . notion that these international norms are important.' He also suggested that Putin might be persuaded to change his mind on supporting Assad's government. 'I'm . always hopeful, and I will continue to engage him,' Mr Obama said. 'Ultimately, we can end deaths much more rapidly if Russia takes a . different approach to these problems.' Speaking . alongside Swedish prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, he concluded: 'The . moral thing to do is not to stand by and do nothing.' Summit: World leader will soon be meeting at the Constantine Palace in St Petersburg, pictured . Banquet: The leaders will dine tomorrow at the Grand Palace Peterhof State Museum . The French parliament is today set to debate a possible military response, although the vote is considered much less important than in Britain or the U.S. because of president Francois Hollande's large majority and relative freedom of action. 'If you want a political solution you have to move the situation,' foreign minister Lauren Fabius said this morning. 'If there's no sanction, Bashar Assad will say, ""That's fine, I'll continue what I'm doing.""' Adding to the tension in the eastern Mediterranean, where Israel and the U.S. test-fired a missile yesterday, Russia today ordered a missile cruiser to take over its operations in the region. The ship, named Moskva, will be joined by a destroyer from Russia's Baltic Fleet and a frigate from the Black Sea Fleet. 'The Cruiser Moskva is heading to the Gibraltar Straits,' a military source told the state news agency. 'In approximately 10 days it will enter the east Mediterranean, where it will take over as the flagship of the naval task force.' Russia is Assad's most powerful global ally, and has consistently opposed Western intervention in Syria's long-running civil war, calling instead for negotiations to reach a diplomatic solution. Attack: A boy who survived the chemical attack on the eastern suburbs of Damascus two weeks ago . Mr Putin suggested in an interview yesterday that Russia would support a UN resolution on military strikes if Assad is proven to have carried out the chemical attack. However, he insisted that it would have been 'ludicrous' for the regime to draw the opposition of the international community by using banned substances such as sarin. 'From our viewpoint, it seems absolutely absurd that the armed forces, which are on the offensive today and in some areas have encircled the so-called rebels and are finishing them off, that in these conditions they would start using forbidden chemical weapons while realising quite well that it could serve as a pretext for applying sanctions against them,' he said. 'If there are data that the chemical weapons have been used, and used specifically by the regular army, this evidence should be submitted to the UN Security Council. 'And it ought to be convincing. It shouldn't be based on some rumours and information obtained by special services through some kind of eavesdropping, some conversations and things like that.' Votes: Presidents Barack Obama and Francois Hollande have both submitted to lawmakers' debates on Syria . The Russian president said he was sorry that Mr Obama had cancelled a one-on-one meeting which was due to precede the G20 summit. 'President Obama hasn't been elected by the American people in order to be pleasant to Russia,' he said. 'And your humble servant hasn't been elected by the people of Russia to be pleasant to someone either. 'We work, we argue about some issues. We are human. Sometimes one of us gets vexed. But I would like to repeat once again that global mutual interests form a good basis for finding a joint solution to our problems.' One country which is likely to support any Western action is Turkey, one of the leading regional powers, whose prime minister said today that he would join an international coalition designed at reining in Assad. Authorities at the Vatican, which has been outspoken about attempting to avoid war in Syria, have asked all ambassadors in the city-state to attend an audience with the Secretary of State tomorrow. It is the first time that the whole diplomatic corps has been summoned since 2003, when John Paul II attempted to prevent the invasion of Iraq. Vatican spokesman Padre Federico Lombardi said the Secretariat of State would put the Pope's position on Syria clearly. The summons was 'a very infrequent and significant even', he added. Francis has already announced a day of peace for Syria on Saturday, 'the meanings and purpose' of which will be explained at the conference of ambassadors, the official Vatican newspaper the Osservatore Romano explained. In an impassioned plea for peace during his Angelus prayer on Sunday Francis said his heart was 'deeply wounded by what is happening in Syria and anguished by the dramatic developments which are looming'. Syria's civil war has been raging for two and a half years, since Assad started cracking down on protests inspired by the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt, and has killed more than 100,000 people. It was revealed this week that more than 2million Syrians had been forced out of their homeland by the fighting, with the vast majority ending up in Lebanon, Turkey or Jordan.","German intelligence intercepted a telephone call from a Hezbollah commander.

10,"A businessman fearing he had cancer after discovering blood in his urine has been left stunned after doctors discovered he has a fully functioning womb - and the blood was from his period. The 37-year-old man, who MailOnine is not identifying, said he has experienced strange symptoms for years, such as a dull ache after sex, but his concerns were always brushed aside by medics. Specialists have since discovered that, as well has having typical exterior male genitalia, he also has an interior uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes and ovaries. A 37-year-old businessman has been shocked to learn he has a fully functioning womb in addition to the typical male genitalia after suffering from a rare genetic disorder . They say he has been having periods since his teens, has experienced PMT, and may even be able to get pregnant. The man, from Lancashire, is now preparing for surgery to remove the womb having lived his whole life as a 'red blooded' male, according to The Sun. Doctors say this is the best way to treat the condition, but have warned him that he could start the menopause once the operation is complete. Persistent Mullerian duct syndrome (PMDS) is a rare genetic disorder which occurs when the body fails to produce or respond to certain hormones while developing during pregnancy. Every foetus contains the beginnings of a womb, known as the Mullerian duct, but if the baby is male then it will produce hormones meaning this reduces and then disappears all together. However in those with PMDS the body either does not produce these hormones, or does not react to them properly, meaning the duct develops into a functioning womb. Because these hormones do not affect the growth of the penis, it means the child will also develop typical exterior male genitals. Persistent Mullerian duct syndrome is a genetic condition which means that both sets of genitals will form. Symptoms include one or both testicles failing to descend, and fleshy hernias in the lower abdomen . The syndrome is believed to be extremely rare, although the exact number of cases each year is largely unknown. The condition is usually spotted in early childhood or around puberty. Symptoms include one or both testes failing to descend properly or fleshy hernias in the lower abdomen. The condition is usually discovered during surgery to treat these problems. All foetuses develop with the beginnings of a womb, known as the Mullerian duct. In the male foetus hormones will be produced causing this to shrink and eventually disappear. But in those with PMDS these hormones will not be produced, or the body will not react to them. This means the Mullerian duct will develop into female sexual organs, including cervix, ovaries and uterus. Because different hormones are responsible for growing a penis, the male reproductive organs will also develop. Symptoms include one or both testicles failing to descend, and fleshy hernias in the lower abdomen. If the condition goes undiscovered into puberty, blood may also occur in the semen or urine after periods start. However in very exceptional cases the problem is not picked up by medics until  adulthood, during which time the patient may have experienced blood in the semen or urine after starting periods, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. The businessman, who is in a relationship with a woman who knows about his condition, says the first sign something was wrong came at six months old, when he had an operation on an undescended testicle. He told Alison Smith-Squire: 'As a child I didn't have any other problems and went through puberty normally, developing a deep voice and body hair. 'But as I reached my teen and 20s I began experiencing a dull ache, during and after sex.' When he was 18 blood first appeared in his urine, leading doctors to suspect he had bladder cancer, but a biopsy came back negative. Eventually he was sent for an MRI, and the images  revealed he has a uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and even a cervix. A consultant has now told him that the ache after sex was caused by PMT, and the blood in his urine came from his periods. As well as surgery to remove the female organs, he will also take part in genetic screening to find out how his gender balances out. He added: 'It's possible tests will show I'm both male and female, but I feel completely right living life as a guy. Even if tests showed I was mostly a woman, I would still continue living as a man.' The 37-year-old is being sent for a hysterectomy at Manchester University Hospital - and has been told the operation may start the menopause (file image)","The 37-year-old man, from Lancashire, has been having periods since his teens.

11,"Kelly Osbourne has quit Fashion Police - just days after her co-star Giuliana Rancic was forced to apologize over a joke about Disney star Zendaya Coleman. The lilac-haired star, 30, has been a fixture on the show since 2011. E! confirmed Kelly's departure on Friday with a statement: 'Kelly Osbourne is departing E!'s Fashion Police to pursue other opportunities, and we would like to thank her for her many contributions to the series over the past five years, during which time the show became a hit with viewers.' Scroll down for video . 'Kelly threw her under the bus': Access Hollywood host Billy Bush said he 'doubts' things are OK between Kelly Osbourne and Giuliana Rancic. However, a source insisted Kelly's possible departure has nothing to do with the Zendaya row . 'Fashion Police will return, as scheduled, on Friday, March 30th at 9:00 p.m. and no decisions have been made on her replacement,' the statement went on to explain. Earlier that day a source told Daily Mail Online: 'Kelly stayed on the show after the beloved Joan Rivers passed away, but nothing has been the same since. 'The chemistry has not been the same between the hosts since the show came back on air and Kelly knows it's time to move on.' Apology: Giuliana Rancic was forced to apologize after joking that Zendaya's dreadlocks at the Oscars would 'smell of patchouli' or 'weed' Kelly fired back on Twitter after her co-star Giuliana said Zendaya's Oscar dreadlocks looked like they would 'smell of patchouli' or 'weed' on the Academy Awards Fashion Police special on Monday night. She raged: 'I DO NOT CONDONE RACISM SO AS A RSULT OF THIS IM SERIOUSLY QUESTIONING STAYING ON THE SHOW[sic].' However, the source insisted: 'This has nothing to do Giuliana. Zendaya accepted Giuliana's apology and she's already moved on to a new hair style! 'Even Kelly tweeted 'this too shall pass' and was over it. 'Joan was the mama bear, she stopped all the quarrels and held the show together, even when Kelly was being testy.' When Fashion Police returned on air following Joan's death, Kathy Griffin was at the helm, with stylist Brad Goreski brought on board. E! execs are now keen to revamp the show before it returns in March. Kelly's bid to leave comes as her dad, rocker Ozzy Osbourne, waded into the argument with some words of warning for Billy Bush. After the Access Hollywood host slammed his daughter Kelly and stood up for pal Giuliana, the star fired back on Twitter. '@BillyBush stop acting like a b****. Act like a man,' Ozzy wrote on Thursday night. 'Lay off Kelly or we'll be going to hospital to get my foot out of your a**. God Bless.' Billy did not respond directly to the Black Sabbath star's message, but joked about it a few hours later while discussing the viral photo of a dress that some see as white and gold and others see as blue and black. 'Need to book an opthomologist AND a proctologist on @AHLive tomorrow. For #TheDress and Ozzy's foot,' he tweeted. Contrary to reports, Billy blasted the suggestion that Kelly tried to stop Giuliana from making the comment about Zendaya's hair - and that the segment was taped three times. As Daily Mail Online has revealed, the joke was actually scripted by Fashion Police writers - and was not off the cuff from Giuliana. Words of warning: Ozzy Osbourne told Billy Bush to 'lay off' his daughter Kelly on Thursday. The rock star is pictured with his daughter in November . Team Giuliana: The Access Hollywood host, seen in November, slammed Kelly over the Zendaya Fashion Police controversy . 'We'll be going to hospital': Ozzy took to Twitter to fire back at Billy . Seeing the funny side: Billy did not respond directly, but joked about the Black Sabbath frontman's comment a few hours later . The 43-year-old said he spoke to Giuliana directly and that she denied claims it was filmed more than once - as did the show's network E!. 'And the Kelly Osbourne part... that never occurred,' Billy went on, adding that he 'doubts' the two hosts have made amends. 'How could it be good?

12,"Vanilla Ice is free on bond after being charged with burglary of a $1million mansion and grand theft. The rapper-turned-home improvement show host, whose real name is Robert Van Winkle, was arrested in Lantana, Florida, on Wednesday amid allegations he broke into a vacant home and stole furniture, a pool heater, bicycles and other items. The burglarized residence, which is in foreclosure, is near a home that Van Winkle, 47, was working on for his show on DIY Network, The Vanilla Ice Project, and some of the stolen property was later found at Van Winkle's home, police say. This as it have been reported he told his work crew he owned the home and sent them over twice to burgle the property. Scroll down for video . Vanilla Ice, whose real name is Robert Van Winkle, was  charged with burglary of a residence and grand theft . Police say Van Winkle stole items from this house in Lantana, Florida, while he was filming his reality show . Van Winkle (center) was released from the Palm Beach County Jail on a $6,000 bond last night . According to the New York Daily News; 'Cops later interviewed Ice's construction foreman, who said Ice told him he'd bought the property and ordered him to fetch stuff from it, including the pool heater and two bikes, worth about $400.In the show, Van Winkle and a crew renovate and flip houses.' Then, earlier this month, a mirrored coffee table and some glass knick-knacks were reported missing from the property. The real estate broker of the burglarized $1million home, Jim Lovely, called the situation a 'hassle', according to NBC Miami. Lovely said: 'Why would you jeopardize going to jail for basically junk? 'It was just worthless furniture and some items so it doesn't make much sense. 'The house wasn't full of Picassos, so it wasn't a high-dollar heist.' The former pop star, who rose to fame with the 1990s hit 'Ice Ice Baby,' was released from the Palm Beach County Jail on a $6,000 bond, according to WPBF. Van Winkle called the situation a 'misunderstanding' that 'was blown out of proportion'. He said: 'It's sad that good news doesn't travel this fast. 'It's just out of proportion and I wish you guys would focus on all the good things I've done. 'It'll all get cleared up, you'll see.' Authorities believe Van Winkle stole furniture, a pool heater (above), bicycles and other items . The broker for the property said the house, which did contain some furniture (above), 'wasn't full of Picassos' Police took Van Winkle into custody after they obtained a search warrant and recovered some of the stolen items at his home in Palm Beach County. The Lantana Police Department said: 'During the investigation, it was determined Robert Matthew Van Winkle played a role in the burglary and theft. 'A search warrant was obtained and executed in unincorporated Palm Beach County in which several of the stolen items were recovered at a residence under the care and control of Robert Van Winkle.' The items have been returned to their owner. In his DIY Network show, Van Winkle and a crew renovate and flip homes. DIY is 'aware' of the situation . The items which Van Winkle allegedly took from the home (pictured) have been returned to their owner . Van Winkle in a 2001 mugshot (left) after he allegedly threatened a man and in a 2008 mugshot (right) after an assault charge . According to Van Winkle, the incident was not related to his television show. He said: 'I wish it was. There's nothing fun about this. 'I wish everybody all the best, and maybe some of the good news will travel this fast in the future.' DIY Network is 'aware' of the situation and 'looking into the matter'. The cable star is still scheduled to appear at the Columbus Dispatch Home and Garden Show on Saturday in Columbus, Ohio. Tommy Quon of TQ Management Agency told the Columbus Dispatch that Van Winkle will be speaking about home renovation. He said: 'Rob will be available to make the home show in Columbus. 'I still don’t know what exactly happened but will get all the facts together and decide a course of action.' Van Winkle has been married to wife Laura since 1997 and they have two daughters together. This is not his first brush with the law; in 1991, he was arrested and pleaded no contest for threatening a homeless man with a gun. A decade later, he was arrested by Florida police and spent a night in jail for assaulting his wife as they argued while driving. He admitted that he had pulled her hair, but said it was to stop her from jumping out of their truck, and was sentenced to probation and attended family therapy sessions. In 2008, Van Winkle was arrested for allegedly assaulting his wife again - but was released the following day after she said he had only pushed her. The case was dropped two weeks later.","Vanilla Ice, whose real name is Robert Van Winkle, was arrested in Lantana, Florida, on Wednesday amid allegations he broke into a vacant home and stole furniture, a pool heater, bicycles and other items.

13,"He was best known for battling the Daleks as one of the best-loved Doctor Whos. But now it has been revealed that Jon Pertwee was a real-life secret agent years before he donned the Time Lord’s cape. The actor, who died in 1996 aged 76, was a senior intelligence agent during the Second World War and reported directly to Winston Churchill. He was also recommended for another role by James Bond creator Ian Fleming – and proved to be an expert in using a range of 007-like gadgets, including a smoking pipe that fired bullets and handkerchiefs containing secret maps. Actor Jon Pertwee, pictured left in the Navy, was a senior secret intelligence agent during World War II before he became well-known for playing Doctor Who, pictured right . The revelations – in a long-lost tape-recorded interview – confirm that Pertwee’s wartime activities were as remarkable as his acting career, which saw him play the third incarnation of the Doctor between 1970 and 1974. Pertwee said he kept silent about the nature of his covert role with the Naval Intelligence Division for decades for fear of breaching the Official Secrets Act. On the tape he says: ‘The team I worked with, the brothers in intelligence, were an amazing  collection of characters. TV favourite: Jon Pertwee battled Daleks and aliens as Doctor Who for four years . ‘There was a huge range of talents all being used to better protect the security of the nation, often in very surprising ways. ‘I did all sorts. Teaching commandos how to use escapology equipment, compasses in brass buttons, secret maps in white cotton handkerchiefs, pipes you could smoke that also fired a .22 bullet. All sorts of incredible things. It suited me perfectly as  I have always loved gadgets. ‘I used to attend meetings where Churchill would be at the end of the table and he would be smoking his cigars. At the end of the meeting, I used to collect the butts and sell them on to the Americans for a few dollars. ‘I don’t remember much of  my first meeting with Churchill except he gave me some priceless advice. He told me to always watch people, that there was a lot you could learn about someone’s character from the little actions they make – which was great advice for an actor.’ Pertwee also worked alongside Ian Fleming during his spell with Naval Intelligence. He recalled: ‘One day Fleming sent me for an interview for a job. They wanted a good French speaker. ‘I thought the job was going to be liaison with the Free French. I did not fancy that at all, so I deliberately messed up the interview, pretending I could not understand what they were saying at times and throwing in the most  inappropriate answers. ‘Afterwards, when Fleming got the report back, he said they did not want me and how badly I had done. I confessed I had done it on purpose because I did not want to work with de Gaulle’s mob. ‘He told me I was a blithering idiot because the interview was a chance to be our man in Tahiti.’ Before taking up his clandestine role, Pertwee narrowly avoided death on the battlecruiser Hood, sunk by the Bismarck in 1941. Jon Pertwee, pictured as Doctor Who with Nicholas Courtney who played Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, made the revelations in a long-lost interview . He recalled: ‘I was on HMS Hood and I got called to the  captain’s cabin. I was told I had passed the captain’s test and I was now a fully fledged officer cadet. I had 20 minutes to pack before being transferred back to Pompey barracks for training. ‘It saved my life. Of the 1,418 crew, only three survived.’ Pertwee’s many obituaries all referred to his wartime service in the Navy, but made no mention of his top-secret role. He gave the interview in 1994 to two young reporters, Matt Adams and David Southwell. They are lifelong Doctor Who fans – and decided this year’s 50th anniversary of the show was the ideal time to publish his revelations in Doctor Who Magazine. Mr Southwell, now an author, said: ‘Eighteen years ago the opportunity arose to exploit our positions with a local paper to wangle an interview at the home of one of our childhood heroes. ‘We have gone on to quiz Oscar-winners and meet Prime Ministers, but no interview was ever more demanding than coming face-to-face with our Doctor.’ Jon Pertwee, pictured as the Doctor with Elisabeth Sladen, said he got to use all sorts of 'incredible equipment'","Actor was a senior intelligence agent during the Second World War.

14,"A father has been hailed as 'SpiderDad' after he donned a superhero costume to surprise his terminally ill son on his birthday. Mike Wilson leapt from a roof at his family home in Basingstoke, Hampshire as part of the birthday stunt for five-year-old Jayden, who has a grade four brain tumour. The heart-warming video of him surprising his son - a huge Spiderman fan - has since been viewed around the world. Scroll down for video . Mike Wilson leapt from a roof above the family's front door in Basingstoke, Hampshire to surprise his son, Jayden, on his fifth birthday . Jayden has been diagnosed with a brain tumour and doctors gave him just a year to live . Jayden was diagnosed with a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) brain stem tumour 15 months ago after his parents took him to hospital following a fall. Mr Wilson told MailOnline: 'We couldn't believe it at first. You never expect something this bad to happen to any of your close family members. 'He was given an average of 12 months to live, and today he's still fighting it like a champ.' Doctors have said Jayden's speech, movement and coordination will continue to deteriorate as he  receives treatment. He is currently finding it . difficult to walk and has weakness in his left arm. As Jayden's fifth birthday approached, Mr Wilson was determined to do something to make his son's day especially memorable. Mr Wilson ordered a special suit to be made in the US before carrying out the stunt for Jayden's birthday . He is an expert in free-running and parkour so was able to pull off the jump without injuring himself . A video of the stunt shows Jayden rushing to hug his favourite superhero after he lands outside their home . Mr Wilson then took the birthday boy inside and played with him while still in character as Spiderman . With his son's bedroom covered in Spiderman posters, Mr Wilson decided there was only one character he would want to wish him happy birthday. Mr Wilson, who is an expert in parkour and free-running, said: 'I've always been a big Spiderman fan myself and, out of no influence, Jayden also absolutely loves him. 'I wanted to surprise him so much with one of his favourite heroes, so I found two costume designers local to me in Basingstoke, who were up for the challenge. 'We had the costume printed in America and then got to work putting it together. It was finished about three weeks before Jayden's birthday so perfect timing to work out how to surprise him.' Jayden got a big hug from his favourite superhero after disguised Mr Wilson became a guest at the party . Family and friends were delighted to see the joy his father's entrance brought to the youngster's face . The family took photos of the occasion so Jayden can remember the day Spiderman came to his house . Mr Wilson added: 'Being a Spiderman fan, I hate it when people pretend to be Spiderman but can't do the right poses, I'm not perfect but I like to try doing my best.' Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most common and aggressive  brain tumours. Unlike other cancers, which are more likely to strike as patients get older, GBM is just as prevalent in young patients and kills more people under 40 than any other cancer. Common symptoms include seizure, nausea, vomiting and headaches, although the most prevalent is a progressive neurological deterioration because of its location near the temporal and frontal lobes. The average sufferer will only survive for 14 months after diagnosis and 2,500 die from their tumours annually. Glioblastoma is extremely difficult to treat for a number of reasons because the tumour cells are very resistant to conventional therapies. Mr Wilson, who is a professional freerunner and has featured in films including Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and Pirates of the Caribbean, spent half an hour playing with his son in character, leaving the youngster star-struck. A video of the surprise stunt shows birthday boy Jayden venturing onto his front doorstep after it appears nobody is there. But he is shocked to see Mr Wilson, concealed by his Spiderman outfit, fly down from the roof and wish him happy birthday. Jayden was given the CT scan in August last year after a fall and, following the discovery of a mass on his brain, he was transferred to a hospital specialising in brain surgery. After an MRI scan and biopsy, doctors told his parents that he has cancer. After what they described as 'the worst weeks of our lives', the couple launched a fundraising to make the rest of Jayden’s life full of special days. The 'SpiderDad' video has been viewed more than 20,000 times on YouTube since it was posted this weekend. Mr Wilson has also been inundated with messages of support on the family's Facebook and gofundme pages. The tumour only came to light when Jayden (pictured with his parents, Lou and Mike, and his sister, Ella) was taken to hospital after banging his head last year . The youngster is a huge Spiderman fan and has posters of the superhero all over the walls of his bedroom .","Jayden Wilson, five, has a glioblastoma multiforme brain tumour.

15,"Two new species of spider, nicknamed Skeletorus and Sparklemuffin, have been discovered by researchers. Discovered in Queenstown, Australia, the creatures are new species of peacock spider. The spiders are given the moniker ‘peacock’ for their bright colours and also the bizarre dancing rituals that they use to attract mates. Two new species of spider have been discovered in Queenstown, Australia. They have been nicknamed Skeletorus and Sparklemuffin (pictured) for their odd looks. The former has a multi-coloured 'fan' that it uses to attract females, and both have a bizarre dancing ritual . The discovery was made in southeast Queensland by graduate student Madeline Girard from the University of California, Berkeley. Scientists have suggested that golden orb-web spiders may be able to ‘count’. The arachnids create ‘prey larders’ of victims trapped in their webs and it appears that they are able to keep track of how many meals they have left. Scientists observed that the spiders search for missing prey when it is taken from their webs. Golden orb-web spiders (Nephila clavipes) wait for prey to fly into their webs, but dead insects are sometimes stolen from their sticky nets by other spiders. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee controlled the number of prey items in the spiders’ ‘larders’ by giving them mealworm larvae and taking them away again. They discovered that the arachnids search for them if they are removed from their web. The scientific names of Sparklemuffin and Skeletorus are Maratus jactatus and Maratus sceletus respectively, but they were given the nicknames for their colourful appearances. Sparklemuffin has blue and red stripes on its abdomen, while Skeletorus has white stripes across its whole body - making it look a bit like a skeleton. Jürgen Otto, an entomologist who specialises in photographing the arachnids and who co-authored the report, told Live Science that Skeletorus looked ‘dramatically different [from] all other peacock spiders known to date, making me think that this group is perhaps much more diverse than we had thought’. At just 0.1 to 0.3 inches (three to seven millimetres) in length, the spiders are very small. Aside from their colour, though, the most intriguing thing about them is the odd mating dance they perform. The males display a flap-like body part called a fan, which is patterned with the stripes, while performing a routine to attract a mate. They also move from one leg to the other, to make themselves more prominent.

Aside from their colour, though, the most intriguing thing about them is the odd mating dance they perform. The male Sparklemuffin is pictured part-way through the dance . ‘Positions may be switched 10 times in a 20 second interval, with only about one second or less of display in a single position,’ the researchers explain about Skeletorus in their report. ‘The fan is prominently elevated and often waggled from side to side during this display, but the greatest and most rapid movement is that of the extended spinnerets, separately twitched from side to side. ‘During display, the pedipalps are often moved up and down in front of the clypeus and chelicerae. ‘One leg is elevated but also flexed, displaying a prominent black stripe with little significant movement.’ The scientific names of Sparklemuffin and Skeletorus are Maratus jactatus (female pictured) and Maratus sceletus respectively, but they were given the nicknames for their colourful appearances .","Two new species of spider have been discovered in Queenstown, Australia.

16,"Israel funding dissident People's Mujahedin of Iran, say officials in Tehran . U.S. officials confirmed today that Israel has been funding and training Iranian dissidents to assassinate nuclear scientists involved in Iran's nuclear program. The claim has already been levelled by the Iranian government who believed that Mossad, Israel's secret service, have been arming dissidents with the terrorist organisation the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK). Last month Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan, 32, a chemistry expert, was killed in a brazen daylight . assassination when two assailants on a motorcycle attached a magnetic . bomb to his car in Tehran. Scroll down for video . Thousands of mourners chanted 'Death to Israel' and 'Death to America' as the coffin of chemical engineer Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan, 32, was carried through the streets of Tehran . Washington insiders confirmed there is a close relationship between Mossad and MEK, according to NBC, but said the U.S. was not involved. Mohammad Javad Larijani, a senior aide to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told NBC: 'Israel does not have direct access to our society. Mujahedin, being Iranian and being part of Iranian society, they have… places to get into the touch with people. 'So I think they are working hand-to-hand very close. And we do have very concrete documents.' At one point, Mr Larijani claimed Mossad had built a replica home of an Iranian scientist so assassins could get to know the layout before they carried out an assassination. MEK denied involvement while the Israel Foreign Ministry declined to comment. A spokesperson for The National Council of Resistance of Iran, of which MEK is the largest member, also denied the claim, saying: 'The claim that the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK) had any role in the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists and the claim of the PMOI/MEK cooperation with Mossad is a total lie and there is not event a scintilla of truth in it. 'The National Council of Resistance of Iran has repeatedly denied the baseless allegation of playing a role in the assassination of nuclear scientists, whose primary source has been the propaganda organs of the clerical regime and the regime's officials.' In an address yesterday, Israeli president Shimon Peres referred to the Iranian nuclear issue. Assassinated: Ahmadi-Roshan's car is taken away for examination after he was killed . He addressed the Iranian people, . saying: 'We were not born enemies and there is no need for us to live as . enemies. Do not allow the flags of hostility to cast a dark shadow on . your heritage. 'You are a sensitive people that aspire to friendship and . peace, not conflict and wars.' However there have been suggestions that Israel's focus on Iran might really be a cover for destabilising President Obama's administration in Washington. Target: Chemistry expert Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan was allegedly killed by Iranian dissidents sponsored by Israel . Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said publicly last month that he believed that an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities might be welcomed by the people of the country. President Obama reiterated his view in an interview earlier this week that the increasing tension with Iran over the country's nuclear program could be resolved peacefully through talks. However he did also say that a range of options were available. According to salon.com, Netanyahu's statements were to paint Obama as 'weak' on Middle Eastern issues and undermine the President's second run for the White House. Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan's death was the latest in a string of attacks on Iranian scientists. Mr Roshan, who was a . chemical engineer and reportedly worked on procurement for the uranium . enrichment plant at Natanz, was killed with his driver by a motorcycle . assassin in rush-hour traffic. The killing of Mr Roshan in January bore a strong . resemblance to earlier killings of scientists working on the Iranian . nuclear programme. His funeral in Tehran several days later saw the ruling clergy stir the crowd of thousands of mourners who had gathered into a frenzy, urging the public to face down Western and Israeli threats against Iran's nuclear programme. They chanted 'Death to . Israel' and 'Death to America' as the coffin was hoisted high and carried through the streets. Several scientists have been killed or injured in the past two years and others have also been attacked or allegedly kidnapped - with Iran blaming the west. In June 2009, Shahram Amiri claimed to have been kidnapped while on a pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia and transferred to the U.S. where he said he was offered $50million to 'spread lies' about Iran's nuclear work. He returned to Iran in July 2010. War of words: Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) has made veiled threats over Iran's nuclear program while Obama (right) has repeatedly said the issue can be resolved peacefully . In January 2010, nuclear scientist Massoud Ali Mohammadi was killed by remote-controlled bomb in Tehran while in November, two car bomb blasts killed a nuclear scientist and wounded another in the capital. Physicist Darioush Rezai, 35, was shot dead by gunmen in eastern Tehran last July after being linked to the nuclear program. The People's Mujahedin, also known as MEK, MKO and PMI, has been named a terror organisation both by the U.S. and Iran. It was accused of being responsible for the deaths of American servicemen and citizens in the 1970s and 80s. Israel, . thought to hold the Middle East's only atomic weapons, has warned Iran . in the past against pursuing its nuclear research and development. Explosion: A cloth covers a blood stain on the road as onlookers watch police on Iran's state-run Al-Alam TV . Iran has accused Israel’s Mossad, the . CIA and Britain’s spy agencies of engaging in an underground . 'terrorism' campaign against nuclear-related targets, including at least . three killings since early 2010 and the release of a malicious computer . virus that temporarily disrupted controls of some centrifuges - a key . component in nuclear fuel production. All three countries have denied the Iranian accusations. The U.S. and its allies are . pressuring Iran to halt uranium enrichment, a key element of the nuclear . programme that the West suspects is aimed at producing atomic weapons. Uranium . enriched to low levels can be used as nuclear fuel but at higher . levels, it can be used as material for a nuclear warhead. Iran denies it is trying to make nuclear weapons, saying its programme is for peaceful purposes only.

17,"A Florida nurse is suing Cesar Millan after she was viciously attacked by a pit bull that had left the Dog Whisperer's training center just six days before. Alison Bitney was visiting a friend in California in September 2014 when the dog named Gus--which had a documented history of aggressive behavior--savagely bit her left arm, which has left her hand with no feeling or function. Bitney filed suit in California against her friend John Vazzoler, the Dog Psychology Center in Santa Clarita, Millan and a rescuer who'd previously saved the dog from being euthanized following an attack in Katy, Texas in February 2013. Scroll down for video . Sued: Florida nurse Alison Bitney is suing Cesar Milan after a pit bull (not the one pictured) that was trained at his California Dog Psychology center savagely attacked her in September . According to the suit, the dog inflicted 'disfiguring open wounds, deep muscle and tendon lacerations' on Bitney, who's now seeking punitive damages, reports the LA Times. The dog had previously been sentenced to die by a Texas judge in February 2014 after he attacked a trainer named Amber Rickles. The canine was in her care after its owner surrendered him for being 'nervous, growling and doesn't like children,' according to Bitney's suit. 'With the pit bull still attached to her left breast, Ms. Rickles backed into a laundry room where the dog released his grip, enabling Ms. Rickles to close the door. The pit bull then broke through the door and attacked Ms. Rickles a third time, latching onto her left arm and breaking it in two places,' reads the suit as obtained by Courthouse News. Despite the horrific nature of the attack and the grueling surgeries and rehabilitation the suit says Rickles had to endure, Gus was rescued by the woman who'd originally brought him to Rickles, Jennifer L. Romano. Bitney says Romano appealed to the judge, who allowed Gus to live so long as Milan's Dog Psychology Center then agreed to take the pit bull and rehabilitate it at Millan's center, according to the 27-page lawsuit. The Dog Whisperer, as he's known, did not have contact with the animal in question, his lawyers say. However, Bitney's suit claims his facility released the dog, which had a history of attacking people and other dogs, while knowing it was a danger . 'Thereafter, Cesar Millan and his Dog Psychology Center, agreed to take over custody and control of the pit bull and not to release it until it was ""fully deemed a safe member of society,""' reads complaint. However, Rickles claims the dog owner fell behind in payments to the center and was 'entrusted it to someone with no training or experience' on September 17, according to the suit. Days later, Bitney was attacked. However, the Dog Psychology Center tells the LA Times that Gus left the facility 'against the strong advice and objection of his trainer.' What's more, Cesar Millan, who is named in the suit, was never in contact with the animal, they say. Bitney is suing for an unknown sum. A call to her attorneys at Scolinos, Sheldon & Nevell was not immediately returned.","Alison Bitney was attacked by a pit bull that had been trained at Cesar Millan's Dog Psychology Center in California.

20,"United States-based airlines reported 17 animal fatalities and 26 injuries in 2014. Of all the carriers, United Airlines reported the most deaths and injuries, while SkyWest boasted a record zero animal fatalities. The data was released by the Department of Transportation, as part of a larger compilation of operating information, in its Consumer Air Travel Report. In 2014, 17 animal fatalities and 26 pet injuries were reported by several U.S. airlines . Most of the injuries reported involved dogs and cats that had been hurt as they attempted to escape from their cages. Alaska - 3 deaths . American - 3 deaths . Delta - 4 deaths . Hawaiian - 2 deaths . SkyWest - 0 deaths . United - 5 deaths . Source: Department of Transportation . Many of the deaths were a result of the animals actually escaping from their transport cages and being hit by other vehicles at the airport. Another major cause of death was underlying health conditions, such as dogs with short or snub noses, which were then aggravated by the stress of travelling. Several airlines are currently reviewing their policies for those types of animals, such as pugs and English bulldogs. These brachycephalic breeds, more frequently than others, experience breathing problems when faced with stressful conditions. Thus, they have a particularly high risk of suffocating in-flight. Whenever possible, it is advised to purchase your pet a spot in the passenger cabin instead of cargo hold . Despite friendly staff and smooth air, animals travelling in the cargo hold of a commercial jet do face their fair share of environmental stresses, such as varying temperatures, loud noises and air pressure drops. However, since two million animals travel on commercial flights each year, the number of those injured, lost or killed is still extremely low. And the total number of animal deaths seems to be declining. In 2011, 35 pets died while travelling on U.S. airlines and in 2012, 29 pets died. Between 2010 and 2013, it was Delta reported the greatest number of animal incidents and was held responsible for 41 of the 97 reported deaths. However, Delta maintains that the reason for their higher numbers is simply because they carry more pets than any other competing airline. Delta is also very open about the lengthy precautions that taken to ensure animal safety on board, which includes not allowing pets to travel between May 15 and September 15 when temperatures my get too hot. They also reserve the right not to carry pets in the cargo hold during periods of extreme cold weather. Good news, since nearly all animal incidents reported to the Department of Transportation involve pets in the cargo hold.","United Airlines reported the most deaths and injuries in 2014.

On the mend: Carmen, a 9-year-old boxer, was taken off the ventilator and was breathing on her own six days after her owner was killed in a house fire . Tragic: Owner Ben Ledford died after the fire despite his dog's brave efforts to save him by shielding his face from the smoke with her body . Carmen was rushed in critical condition to CARE Center veterinary clinic in Cincinnati last week suffering from severe damage to her lungs cause by smoke inhalation. 'A lot of dogs instinctively know when there’s a crisis going on and so a lot of them do go try to protect their owners,' said veterinarian Dr. Marlo Anderson. After a weekend spent in an oxygen chamber being fed fluids intravenously, the hulking canine began to turn the corner Monday. On Tuesday morning, the team at CARE Center posted an update on their Facebook page sharing the good news that Carman was taken off the ventilator and her vital signs were holding steady. The 9-year-old dog is currently getting oxygen through a nasal tube and is starting to wake up from the sedative drugs. The critical care staff were expecting to see Carman up fully awake and moving around by Wednesday. ‘She's doing very well. We're very happy with where her progress is at this point,’ Dr. Marlo Anderson, the critical care specialist, told WCPO. Once Carmen recovers, her owner's brother, Philip Ledford, plans to adopt her. Emily Leford, Ben and Philip’s sister, said her late brother had a very special relationship with his pet.

Mr Ledford has set up a donations page to help with Carmen’s medical bills. As of late Tuesday night, the campaign has drawn more than $19,000in donations, inching towards the $25,000 goal. ‘While we're not out of the woods yet and there is still significant care that she needs, her chances of survival have increased,’ the Ledford family wrote on the fundraiser page. ‘We're hopeful that we will actually be able to take her home one day.’ At least one person, Ron Mitchell, attempted to get Ben Ledford to safety before firefighters arrived but the fire and smoke were too much for him.

23,"Charles Manson's fiancee has spoken out for the first time about her engagement to tell the world: 'I think he's the most handsome man in the world.' Afton Elaine Burton, who goes by the mononym 'Star', tells Inside Edition on Monday that she still plans to marry the 80-year-old convicted murderer despite the fact that their marriage license expired earlier this month. She insists Manson did not brutally murder Sharon Tate and six others and adds that she wants to 'take very good care of him'. Her words come amid claims she tricked her murderous beau into an engagement so that she could put his corpse on display after his death. Vow: Afton Elaine Burton, 27, insists she will marry Charles Manson although their marriage license expired . Side-stepping the allegation, Burton reminds the interviewer that she moved to California nine years ago to care for Manson, who is not eligible for parole until 2027 - when he will be 92. 'Yes, I'm going to marry Charles Manson,' Burton declares. Manson has been in prison in Corcoran, California, since 1969, when he was convicted of murdering Roman Polanski's wife, the actress Sharon Tate, and six others. He was aided by three women - his 'followers'. Leslie Van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel, remain encarcerated. A third, Susan Atkins, died of cancer in prison. According to the New York Post, Burton tried to get the rights to Manson's remains without marrying him, but was turned down. The paper claimed that she offered herself up as a his bride after being rebuffed, because Californian law allows spouses to choose what happens to their husbands' and wives' bodies after they die. The claims come from Daniel Simone, a journalist who has spoken extensively with Manson and is planning to write a book on him. He claimed that Manson is now wise to the plot - and thinks it is ridiculous because he believes that he's immortal. Simone told the Post: 'He's finally realized that he's been played for a fool.' 'He feels he will never die... Therefore, he feels it's a stupid idea to begin with.' Simone also said that Manson never had any intention of marrying Star - but he kept up the pretense because they would bring presents to his prison cell in Corcoran, California. The prospect of Star becoming Mrs Manson diminished this week after it emerged the couple's 90-day marriage license had expired. Killer: Manson was convicted of killing Sharon Tate and six others with his 'followers'. He is pictured left during his trial in March, 1971, and of right in a mugshot taken on March 18, 2009 at California State Prison, Corcoran . Prison rules mean the two could only marry during visiting hours on a weekend - and they had their final shot two weeks ago before the license expired on February 5. Simone said that Manson has been unable to receive visitors lately because he is being treated for an infection. In a statement, Star has said she an Manson will still marry - but that an 'interruption in logistics' got in the way. Manson has been in prison for more than four decades after being put away for a series of murders in 1969 killings. His victims included the brutal murder of director Roman Polanski's actress wife, Sharon Tate, who was eight-and-a-half months pregnant. Star insisted last year that she and Manson were madly in love and already consider themselves married. 'I'm completely with him, and he's completely with me. It's what I was born for, you know. I don't know what else to say,' she told CNN in August of the now gray-haired killer, who has a swastika tattooed on his forehead. She said she had been following Manson's 'philosophy' since she was a teenager and moved to Corcoran, where the convicted murderer is detained, to be closer to him. Manson was married twice before he was jailed, first to Rosalie Jean Willis from 1955 to 1958, and later to Candy Stevens between 1959 and 1963. He was sentenced to death in 1969 along with four of his disciples for having led the killing of seven people, but their sentences were later commuted to life in prison. Manson applied for parole in 2012 but was denied release and is not eligible to apply again until 2027. Manson headed an apocalyptic cult that committed murders in upscale, mostly white neighborhoods of Los Angeles in order to blame the crimes on African Americans, in the hope of sparking what he termed a 'Helter Skelter' race war.","Afton Elaine Burton, 27, insists she will marry Charles Manson despite marriage license expiring earlier this month.

24,"A former Power Ranger has been arrested for allegedly murdering his roommate with a sword. Ricardo Medina Jr, the Red Ranger, has been charged with killing Joshua Sutter by stabbing him in the abdomen with the sharp weapon on Saturday afternoon. The 37-year-old, who reportedly called 911 himself, was taken into custody in Palmdale, California, shortly after, reports claim. Sutter was taken to hospital and pronounced dead. Murder accusation: TMZ reported that Ricardo Medina Jr stabbed his roommate in the abdomen and was arrested. He is pictured left at a fan convention and right in Power Rangers Samurai . According to TMZ, the roommates started fighting at around 3.30pm. Medina went into his room with his girlfriend but Sutter tried to follow them, the report states. It was then that Medina allegedly dealt the fatal blow. He has been charged and detained, with his bail set at $1 million. Medina starred in the 2002 TV series Power Rangers Wild Force before playing Deker in the 2011 series Power Rangers Samurai. He also voiced Deker in the video game Power Rangers Samurai, and in the movie Power Rangers Samurai: A New Enemy, which hit theaters in 2012. Born and raised in Los Angeles, California, Medina was also pursuing a singing career and had stints in ER and CSI, according to his IMDb profile. 'Attack': The actor allegedly speared his roommate during an argument then called 911 himself . 'He is a great friend and a great client. It's something I can't even conceive. I don't see that in him. He was a very helpful guy and great with his dog. It's such a shock,' said Gar Lester, Medina's former agent who has known the actor for 12 years, told ABC7. Medina's neighbor, Justin Adamson, said the actor had moved into the block about two months ago. He told ABC7: 'We brought him some bread and just tried to interact a little bit with him, but he was more of the, you know, the type of guy that didn't really want to communicate.'","Ricardo Medina Jr, 37, was charged with murder after allegedly stabbing his roommate Joshua Sutter in the abdomen.

A 'source close to Apple' told The Information that the firm 'would be lucky to ship [the watch] before Valentine's Day'. Apple is said to be unhappy with the watch's battery life, and the long lead time before the $349 (£216) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it's released early next year. Scroll down for video . A 'source close to Apple' told The Information that the firm 'would be lucky to ship [the Apple Watch] before Valentine's Day'. Apple is said to be unhappy with the watch's battery life, and the long lead time before the $349 (£216) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it's released early next year . And The Information also reported that Apple partners and employees expected the watch to launch this year. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook unveiled the watch at a launch event earlier this month. But despite the range of impressive features unveiled by Mr Cook, there was something he failed to mention: battery life. The telling omission, suggests the watch’s battery life will be the Achilles Heel of the device when it sold in early 2015. Most existing smartwatches on the market, such as Pebble and MetaWatch, tend to last up to a week on a single charge. The closest Cook came to talking about the battery life for the Watch was saying that users would ‘charge it at night.’ The watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.' Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll a list. The crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen. Different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes, and force touches. The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom. Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch. Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications. It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone. Users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply, or have it transcribed to them. There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji. Siri also is built into the Apple Watch. During an interview in Bloomberg Business Week, Apple's senior vice president of operations Jeff WIlliams said: 'We want to make the best product in the world. 'One of our competitors is on their fourth or fifth attempt, but nobody is wearing them.' The company's chief executive added that the Apple Watch ‘can be worn all day, for any occasion,’ but hourly figures were notably absent. A source said that Apple is unhappy with the watch's battery life, according to Re/Code. Another source confirmed to the technology site that that the battery life ‘is about a day now.’ Apple's chief executive Tim Cook (pictured) unveiled the watch at a launch event earlier this month. Although he didn't reveal battery life details, Mr Cook did spend some time talking about the Watch's charging system, which combines Apple’s MagSafe technology with inductive charging . The watch has a completely new user interface (left), different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown' (right) presented by chief executive Tim Cook . The company's chief executive added that the Apple Watch ‘can be worn all day, for any occasion,’ but hourly figures were notably absent. The product costs $349 (£216) and is now not expected to launch until at least February next year . A spokesperson for Apple declined to provide battery details to MailOnline and said they will be revealed closer to launch next year. Like many of Apple’s other products, the Apple Watch appears to have a sealed back, which means the battery cannot be replaced. This suggests that the entire $349 (£216) device will have to be replaced, once the battery eventually deteriorates from constant charging and use. Another concern is the launch of the health and activity-tracking apps on the Apple Watch, which will rely on adequate battery life for round-the-clock monitoring. Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a vibrations users feel on their wrist . It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone . Companies like Fitbit and Withings have health trackers that are designed to be worn at night too, monitoring sleep patterns through movements. However, if the Watch has to be charged at night, vital health signs could be missed by the gadget which Apple says will ‘motivate people to be more active and more healthy.’ Apple did, however, spend some time talking about the Watch's charging system, which combines Apple’s MagSafe technology with inductive charging. The long lead time before the product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it's released, since app developers have more time to create apps specifically for the watch. Apple’s silence on battery life suggests the company is still working to improve the feature. The success of the device could hang on whether or not it manages to do it in time.","A'source close to Apple' told The Information that the firm 'would be lucky to ship [the Apple Watch] before Valentine's Day'

26,"A wire-tapping lawsuit in San Francisco against Google could cost the internet giant billions of dollars or nothing, depending on the result of a search of two hard company hard drives. 22 plaintiffs accuse the search engine company of vacuuming personal data off their Wi-Fi networks with its roving Street View cars between 2008 and 2010. If successful the lawsuit would be a landmark judgement, as online corporations have faced criticism but rarely judgments for their handling of users' privacy. Snooped: Google is accused of indiscriminately gathering data from unsecured Wi-Fi networks with Street View cars . The Street View cars were deployed with 360-degree camera systems to capture images for Google Street View and Google Earth. When the Street View cars were announced, Google did not reveal they were also loaded with wireless analyzers, tools designed to 'sample, collect, decode, and analyze' data sent over accessible Wi-Fi networks. That led to Street View cars vacuuming up huge amounts of 'payload' data, which includes passwords, email and multimedia like videos and photos. Even data from Voice Over Internet Protocols, such as the Internet phone service Skype, may have been collected. Bloomberg reports that the case stalled while Google fought to appeal the wiretapping accusation, claiming that  data on unsecured wireless networks was equivalent to that on AM/FM transmissions. The Supreme Court declined to hear Google's case in June. Mapping: Street View cars were intended to map the globe and capture photos for Google Street View and Google Earth . Rogue: Marius Milner added code that turned Street View cars into vacuums of personal data, which Google alleges he did on his own . Even as the lawsuit goes forward, proof will need to be found that personal data was collected by searching two hard drives held as evidence in San Francisco. Both sides have been ordered to settle on a neutral expert to comb through the hard drives to find traces of data being picked up. Once over that hurdle, the plaintiffs will have an easier time winning what would be a watershed online privacy lawsuit, as they do not have to prove they suffered damage from Google's actions or that Google initiated the project maliciously. In the past, Google claimed that the wireless analyzer program was the work of a 'rogue' programmer, which the corporation only found out about after it was initiated. The employee, first referred to as 'Engineer Doe,' was later outed as Marius Milner, a respected British expert on wireless networks, according to the New York Times. Street View cars throughout the United States, Canada and Europe collected data, triggering various investigations. In 2013, the search engine company said it would pay $7million to settle with over 30 states and the District of Columbia over its data collection practices. The ongoing lawsuit, which has yet to move to the class action phase, would net up to $10,000 in damages for each affected user, leading a windfall judgement.","Google is accused of roving Street View cars collecting data from unsecured Wi-Fi networks.

29,"Campaigners for survivors of child sexual abuse have savaged David Cameron after he called claims of a Home Office paedophile cover-up a 'conspiracy theory'. Referring to the findings of a review into allegations of a VIP paedophile ring, the Prime Minister said on the campaign trail in Rochester that ‘conspiracy theorists’ would have to ‘look elsewhere’. Last night the author of that review flatly called Mr Cameron's comments 'wrong', while the National Association for People Abused in Childhood said his intervention was 'appalling'. David Cameron teaches politics at Strood Academy in Rochester: He sparked outrage among victims of child sexual abuse after he called claims of an Establishment paedophile cover-up a 'conspiracy theory' It seemed to directly contradict an extraordinary admission by Theresa May, the Home Secretary, that there 'might have been a cover-up' of an Establishment paedophile ring by her department in the 1980s. The comments by Mrs May and Mr Cameron came after the publication of a report into how her department handled papers relating to alleged child abusers at Westminster. NSPCC boss Peter Wanless and Richard Whittam QC had tried to track down 114 files that went missing in the Home Office. Just one was found; another was shredded by the Ministry of Justice, which took possession of the dossier, just three years ago. Mr Cameron seemed to directly contradict an extraordinary admission by Theresa May, the Home Secretary, that there 'might have been a cover-up' The men concluded: ‘It is ... not possible to say whether files were ever removed or destroyed to cover up or hide allegations of organised or systematic child abuse by particular individuals because of the systems then in place. We cannot say that no file was removed or destroyed for that reason.’ Their report also revealed the list of names which officials were asked to search under when looking for the missing files – suggesting possible links to the so-called Dickens dossier. It included known paedophiles such as Cyril Smith and members of the Paedophile Information Exchange, which campaigned to legalise sex with children. It also featured senior political figures such as former Home Secretary Leon Brittan, Labour peer Lord Janner, and two Tory grandees, Sir Peter Morrison and Sir Peter Hayman, who are both now dead. Police have questioned Lord Brittan and searched Lord Janner’s home in recent months, but neither has been charged. In a statement to MPs, Mrs May said of the latest findings: ‘It doesn’t prove or disprove the Home Office acted appropriately in the 1980s.’ She added: ‘There might have been a cover-up.’ But Mr Cameron, speaking in Rochester where he is desperately trying to head off another possible by-election win for Ukip, contradicted both his Home Secretary and the findings of the report. 'There will be lessons from the report and people should study it closely. But I think it is important that it says that there wasn't a cover-up,' he said. 'Some of the people who've been looking for conspiracy theories will have to look elsewhere'. Last night, Mr Wanless said his comments were ‘wrong’. The National Association for People Abused in Childhood told The Sun: 'It's an appalling thing for the Prime Minister to say.' 'Wrong': The response of NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless to Mr Cameron's comments. He carried out the review into Home Office handling of historic allegations of child abuse that the PM was referring to . The new report centred on the work of late Conservative MP Geoffrey Dickens, who wrote to Lord Brittan in 1983 to say he would expose eight public figures suspected of child abuse unless action was taken. Lord Brittan has said in a statement that he ‘told Mr Dickens that I would ensure that the papers were looked at carefully by the Home Office and acted on as necessary’. The files were never published. Earlier this year, amid revelations in the Mail about Smith and the PIE, it emerged that the Dickens dossier had gone missing, along with a string of other documents. After an initial review by the Home Office found they could not be traced, Mrs May appointed Mr Wanless and Mr Whittam to conduct a full trawl across Whitehall. Former Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens (left), who died in 1995, said he gave details of Establishment paedophiles – known as 'Dickens dossier' – to then Home Secretary Leon Brittan (right) in 1983 . Yesterday, the two men said one file had come to light as a result of ‘heightened awareness’ of the subject in the Home Office – but none of Dickens’ were found. The report also failed to rule out a whistleblower’s claims that the Home Office directly awarded tens of thousands of pounds of public money to the PIE. Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP who has raised the issue of historic child abuse, branded the review a ‘whitewash’. He said: ‘We [cannot] just gloss over the past and hope it all goes away.’ And campaigning journalist Don Hale, who was given a dossier naming VIP paedophiles in the 1980s, said the review was a 'complete waste of time', telling The Sun's Stephen Hawkes: 'It was always going to fail.'","David Cameron called claims of a Home Office paedophile cover-up a 'conspiracy theory'

And producer Jesse Stern said: 'RIP Glen Larson. Thank you so much. Magnum, The Fall Guy, Sheriff Lobo, BJ McKay and his best friend Bear, Manimal. I loved you.' Born in in Long Beach in 1937, Larson started in the business in the 1950s as a singer in the clean-cut pop group The Four Preps, which later composed a number of the theme songs in his TV shows. After first becoming enthralled with storytelling as a child, he then went on to work for Quinn Martin Sr on several productions, including The Fugitive, on which he gained his first credit as a writer in 1966.

In following years, he produced a number of popular shows, including ABC’s It Takes a Thief, which starred his fellow Hollywood High School alum Robert Wagner as a burglar for the U.S. Government. He also took it upon himself to rewrite the original pilot for The Six Million Dollar Man - based on the 1972 novel, Cyborg - after ABC initially spurned it. The pilot, alongside scripts for a pair of 90-minute telefilms, convinced then-network executive Barry Diller to greenlight the action series, starring Lee Majors as a former astronaut  with bionic implants. During his long-running career, Larson also created NBC's McCloud, Alias Smith & Jones, B.J. and The Bear, Switch (another series starring Wagner), Manimal and The Misadventures of Sheriff Lobo.

His show Battlestar Galactica - for which he was given a then-unprecedented $1million-per-episode budget -  lasted just one season on ABC from 1978-79, yet the impact was incredible. The science-fiction series, featuring Lorne Greene and Richard Hatch as leaders of a homeless fleet wandering through space, was greatly influenced by Larson’s Mormon beliefs. Although it was axed after 24 episodes due to its cost, in 2003, it was re-imagined and remade, beginning with a three-hour mini-series, followed by a weekly series which ran from 2004 to 2009. Quincy M.E., starring Jack Klugman as an LA-based medical examiner, ran for 148 episodes on NBC from 1976 to 1983, while CBS's Magnum P.I. aired for a whopping eight seasons from 1980 to 1988.

And ABC's The Fall Guy, with Lee Majors, Douglas Barr and Heather Thomas, ran for five seasons (113 episodes) from 1981 to 1986. When asked how he kept up with such a huge workload in 2009, Larson, who  left Universal for Fox following his production of Knight Rider, said he attempted to keep every show under control. 'I tried to stay with things until I thought they were on their feet and they learned to walk and talk,' he told the Archive of American Television. 'If you believe if something, you must will it through, because everything gets in the way. Everyone tries to steer the ship off course.' But despite his incredible career, Larson never won an Emmy; earning just three nominations, two for his work on McCloud and one for Quincy. However, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1985. '[Our shows] were enjoyable, they had a pretty decent dose of humor. All struck a chord in the mainstream. What we weren’t going to do was win a shelf full of Emmys,' he told the news station. Hit: Meanwhile CBS's Magnum P.I. (with Tom Selleck, pictured) aired for eight seasons from 1980 to 1988 . 'We got plenty of nominations for things, but ours were not the kind of shows that were doing anything more than reaching a core audience.' Larson is survived by his wife Jannie, brother Kenneth, five daughters and four sons (including his son, James) from his former wives, Carol Gourley and Janet Curtis.

31,"Extraordinary new drugs have cleared tumours that have spread throughout lung cancer patients’ whole bodies, scientists say. Some are even talking of the new immunotherapy drugs effectively curing patients of the disease, which has a grim survival record. After lung cancer has spread to other organs – and by the time it’s spotted, it usually has – most patients die within months. Dr Mick Peake: The doctor saw one man in his 40s who had lung cancer which had spread to his liver, brain, bones and adrenal glands - but the disease disappeared . Of all cancers it is by far the biggest killer in Britain, claiming 35,000 lives a year, more than bowel and breast cancer combined. But now scientists are reporting incredible success treating advanced lung cancer with drugs such as nivolumab. Next week ‘stellar’ trial results for the antibody drug will be presented at the world’s biggest cancer conference, for the American Society of Clinical Oncology, in Chicago. Doctors will reveal that a quarter of 129 US patients with advanced lung cancer have survived at least two years after starting nivolumab. Dr Mick Peake of Glenfield Hospital in Leicester said: ‘You would expect patients in that group to survive a few months, if you’re lucky. So to get 24 per cent living two years is extraordinary.’ He saw one man in his 40s had lung cancer which had spread to his liver, brain, bones and adrenal glands, he said. ‘By the time it’s spread that far, you don’t expect patients to last more than a couple of months. But in a recent scan, his doctor could not find any evidence of residual disease.’ Dr Peake said it was also remarkable that so many were responding to this treatment. Of those treated with the optimum dose, 45 per cent were alive after two years. He said: ‘In any trial you get the odd patient who does very well, but this is an order of magnitude above that.’ Glenfield Hospital: Dr Mick Peake of Glenfield Hospital in Leicester said in any trial you get the odd patient who does very well, but this is an order of magnitude above that . Last September, The Mail on Sunday revealed these drugs were being used to treat skin cancer with great success. Now they are having a similar effect on lung cancer, which is 15 times more deadly. Nivolumab is one of a new class of drug, called anti-PD1s and anti-PDL1s, which help the immune system ‘see’ that tumours are deadly foes. Explaining how the drugs work Dr Peake said: ‘Tumours develop a ‘cloak’, like a Star Wars force field, around themselves. This stops the immune system attacking them. ‘These drugs take that force field away and allow the body’s immune response to fight the tumour. The beauty is we do not have the adverse side effects of conventional treatment.’ Professor Dean Fennell, who has been treating British patients with a similar drug, MK3475, said: ‘This is an enormous deal. There are patients on treatment who’ve been going an incredibly long time.’ He added it was ‘not inconceivable’ that they could be an ‘effective cure’ for some – allowing patients to live virtually disease-free for years. Dr Julie Brahmer. of John Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Centre in Baltimore, who has helped spearhead US nivolumab trials, said it was ‘a little early’ to call it a cure. But she added: ‘That’s what our hope is.’ She has also witnessed patients whose tumours have shrunk to almost nothing, with some people still well three years after treatment began. One is still well a year after treatment stopped – suggesting the immune system ‘learns’ from the intravenous therapy. However, Dr Brahmer, a supporter of US charity Uniting Against Lung Cancer, warned these new drugs were no ‘magic bullet’ for lung cancer. ‘The next step is to make the drugs even better – combining them with standard treatments, other antibodies, and by priming the tumours. We have to figure out how to make them work for everyone.’","Scientists have reported success treating advanced lung cancer with drugs.

32,"It is the episode of Fawlty Towers best remembered for the line ‘Don’t mention the war’ and John Cleese’s silly walk when impersonating Hitler. The references have proved controversial before, but when The Germans was repeated on BBC2 on Sunday evening it wasn’t our European neighbours that the corporation was worried about offending. Instead, the episode was edited to omit racist language – only for some viewers to then complain that the BBC was ‘airbrushing history’. Scroll down to see the clips . 'Don't mention the war': John Cleese as Basil Fawlty giving an Adolf Hitler impression to German guests, with Polly in the background played by Connie Booth . The Germans episode of Fawlty Towers was voted number 11 in Channel 4¿s One Hundred Greatest TV Moments in 1999 . In one scene one of the hotel’s permanent residents, Major Gowen, uses derogatory terms to describe black people. It was included in the episode’s first airing in October 1975, but this time around the major’s words were edited out. The scene involves Basil Fawlty and the major, played by actor Ballard Berkeley, exchanging their normal pleasantries before the conversation moves on to Basil’s wife Sybil and women in general. The major tells Fawlty about the time he took a woman to see India play cricket  at the Oval. He then says: ‘The strange thing was, throughout the morning she kept referring to the Indians as niggers. “No, no, no,” I said, “the niggers are the West Indians. These people are wogs”.’ Several years ago there were concerns that the episode would never be shown again because of the offensive words. However, recent editions of The Complete Fawlty Towers DVD, distributed by BBC Worldwide, have not been edited and included the segment that was cut by the BBC on Sunday. Some fans took to the BBC’s Points Of View message board yesterday to say they ‘despaired’ at the ‘unnecessary’ editing. One . wrote: ‘You can’t airbrush history away and I doubt if anyone but the . terminally thin-skinned could be offended by the major, a character . we’re clearly supposed to laugh at rather than with.’ Ballard Berkeley  as the Major Gowen, who makes the offensive remark. Viewers said that the 'bigoted character' was meant to be laughed at - not with . Another posted: ‘The point is that the major is a racist old bigot, incongruous with modern society – even in the Seventies. The audience isn’t supposed to agree with him, they’re supposed to laugh at him. The whole episode is about xenophobia in various forms – it’s social satire. I instinctively dislike the airbrushing of history.’ A third viewer wrote: ‘So how sad BBC you have finally succumbed and lost the guts to transmit the episode of Fawlty Towers “The Germans” in its original form. The major’s speech of his experience of going out with a woman to the Oval is one of the funniest things ever. ‘You edited it because it includes the W-word and the N-word. Let’s face it, the whole episode and much of Fawlty Towers is racist by today’s standards and misogynistic, but above all it is hilarious. ‘We are all grown up, you know. We, the vast majority of us, can laugh at this without being racists. ‘It’s about time you grew up BBC, and trusted your audience. We know what is acceptable and what is not and what is funny and why, and the fact it is of a time which is now long past. We understand context, the major is a figure of fun, he doesn’t whip up hatred.’ Fawlty Towers was written by and starred Cleese and his then wife Connie Booth. The Germans was the sixth episode of the 12 that were made and was voted number 11 in Channel 4’s One Hundred Greatest TV Moments in 1999. The series has continued to entertain families since being made in the 1970s and was in 2000 voted by industry professionals to be the best British series of all time. A BBC spokesman said: ‘We are very proud of Fawlty Towers and its contribution to British television comedy. ‘But public attitudes have changed significantly since it was made and it was decided to make some minor changes, with the consent of John Cleese’s management, to allow the episode to transmit to a family audience at 7.30pm on BBC2.’ CENSORED Cleeses's 'Hitler Walk' was previously deemed one of greatest moments of TV .","The Germans episode of Fawlty Towers was voted number 11 in Channel 4's One Hundred Greatest TV Moments in 1999.

33,"A 35-year-old Detroit mother accused of killing two of her chidlren and stuffing their bodies inside a deep freezer said through her attorney Thursday that she loves her two surviving kids and wants to see them. Prosecutors charged Mitchelle Blair Thursday with felony murder, premeditated murder and torture. Court officers carrying out a March 24 eviction at the family's apartment found the frozen corpses of 13-year-old Stoni Ann Blair and 9-year-old Stephen Gage Berry. Impassive: Mitchelle Blair, pictured left and right in court Thursday, appeared stone-faced during her arraignment on murder and abuse charges . Laundry list of counts: Prosecutors charged Mitchelle Blair Wednesday with felony murder, premeditated murder and torture. Inked: The tattooed names of her four children, including Stoni and Stephen, are visible on her right forearm below the crossed out name of an ex . Blair initially was charged with child abuse, but more charges had been expected after autopsies revealed the siblings were beaten to death. Investigators believe Stephen died in August 2012 and Stoni died the following May. Blair's two surviving children — ages 8 and 17 — have been placed into a relative's care. Appearing in court Thursday for a probable-cause hearing, with the names of her four children inked on her forearm, Blair was arraigned on two counts of felony murder, first-degree premeditated murder and torture. The 35-year-old woman previously had been charged with four counts of first-degree child abuse and one count of committing first-degree child abuse in the presence of another child. Responding to a reporter's question about the woman’s two surviving children, Blair’s defense attorney, Wyatt Harris, said his client 'loves her children very much.' He then added he is sure Blair 'wants to see her children,' reported The Detroit Free Press. Blair's daughter, Stoni (left) and son Stephen (right). Stoni's sister claimed Blair killed Stoni by strangling her with a T-shirt and suffocated her with a plastic bag .

I did it!’ Attorney Wyatt Harris (right) told reporters his client loves her surviving children and wants to see them . Harris entered a not guilty plea on behalf of Blair, who appeared impassive as she stood by his side with her tattooed arms crossed and wearing blank expression on her face. The attorney made a motion for an independent mental health evaluation for his client, which Judge Kenneth King granted. Experts will assess Blair’s mental competency to waive her Miranda rights, to be held criminally responsible for her actions and to stand trial. Judge King also gave the defense attorney permission to review two videotaped interviews conducted with Blair's surviving children by child advocates working with law enforcement. At the request of the prosecution, the lawyer was ordered not to share the recordings with anyone other than doctors or members of Blair’s family. Mitchelle Blair was ordered held without bail pending a preliminary hearing scheduled for June 19. According to police, during her arrest March 24, Blair admitted to killing the two children, saying: ‘They’re both dead! I did it!’ She also allegedly stated that she was not evil, ‘It was just an evil act.’ A medical examiner has determined that the exact cause of death was blunt force trauma and ruled it a homicide. A joint funeral for Stoni and Stephen will be held April 13 in Detroit. At Harris' (left) request, a judge ordered a mental health evaluation for Blair to determine if she was cempetent enough to waive her Miranda rights and stand trial . Details of death and extreme abuse emerged Thursday as Mitchelle Blair appeared in court, two days after the bodies of her 9-year-old son, Stephen Berry, and 13-year-old daughter, Stoni Blair, were discovered . Child welfare officials revealed last week that Blair's two surviving children had been terribly abused in a house of horrors. The Michigan Department of Human Services is taking steps to end Blair's rights to her two other children, a 17-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son, who are currently with a relative. In a court filing, the state said her daughter described a home where she and her surviving brother were beaten with an extension cord and piece of wood and hit and burned with a hot curling iron. Medical exams revealed evidence of abuse, including numerous scars, on the surviving children. Twenty-five scars were found on the boy's back that were consistent with being hit by an extension cord, according to a petition obtained by the Detroit News. Blair's teenage daughter also described how her siblings were killed, according to court papers. 'Blair tortured Stephen for approximately two weeks prior to his death by tying a belt around his neck, throwing hot water on him while in the shower and putting a plastic bag over his head,' the state said, quoting the 17-year-old. Court officers serving an eviction notice at Blair's home (pictured) opened the freezer and found the bodies of her daughter Stoni Ann Blair and her son Stephen Gage Berry . In a court filing, the state said the teen described a house of horrors, where she and her surviving brother were beaten with an extension cord and piece of wood, hit with a hot curling iron and burned with a clothing iron . Stephen was 'unresponsive' on Aug 30, 2012, and Blair wrapped his body in bed linen and put him in the freezer, the state said. Nine months later, Blair became 'enraged' when Stoni said she didn't like her surviving siblings and strangled the girl with a T-shirt and suffocated her with a plastic bag, the department said. Blair then made the teen 'put Stoni in the deep freezer following her death,' the agency said. The bodies of the children were discovered on Tuesday while court officers were serving an eviction notice. The apartment was reportedly filled with food and trash and rendered almost 'unlivable', according to the report. Blair's 8-year-old boy also was aware that his sister and brother were killed and subsequently placed in the freezer, the department said. While being questioned, Blair told investigators she placed Stephen 'in a boiling hot tub of water until his feet blistered' because she found out Stephen was allegedly sexually assaulting a relative, according to the Detroit News. Blair also told police that when he died, she wrapped him 'in his favorite blanket' and put him in the freezer, the police report states. The surviving children did not mention sexual abuse when they were interviewed by counselors, according to a juvenile court petition. A woman walks past notes left on the door at at the family's home on Wednesday. The teenager said neither she nor her siblings have attended school for two years . Blair's teenage daughter said neither she nor her siblings have attended school for two years. Neighbor Shanetria Lanier, 21, told the Detroit News Blair home-schooled her children and 'that's why no schools were wondering where they were'. There is no record of the children attending classes, according to a Detroit Public Schools official. People did notice that two of her children seemed to disappear about a year ago. Lanier told the newspaper: 'When people asked her where her other two kids are, she said they were at their aunt's house. 'Or sometimes she'd tell people they stayed inside because they didn't like to be around people.' Tori Childs, who also lives in the complex, told the Detroit News she often saw the children and sometimes gave them clothes or food. She said they were 'the nicest kids' who were 'so respectable'. 'This is just wrong,' she said in tears. Childs said she saw two bodies on the floor after police arrived at the home on Tuesday. 'It was a little girl and a little boy,' she said. 'The little girl had on a pink jacket.' Earlier Thursday, Blair appeared in court on child abuse charges via a video feed from a police lockup. Magistrate Renee McDuffee entered a not-guilty plea on her behalf. The state said it investigated allegations of abuse in 2002 and 2005. Blair was referred to counseling and allowed to keep custody of her children. Toni Williams, 28, left, and Natasha Bell, 30, leave balloons at the house on Wednesday . The two fathers of Blair's surviving children are unfit to care for them, according to the state. Together they owe $50,000 in child support and haven't seen the kids in two to three years. Neighbors say Blair has lived in the complex at least 10 years. She was unemployed and having money troubles, and she had gotten behind on her rent. Neighbors said they knew about the impending eviction. Court records show a judgment filed last month against her for $2,206 owed to the complex. 'While we all understand the desire to know what happened in that home is strong, I will ask you to be mindful of the two children who were also in that home and are still living,' Detroit Police Chief James Craig told reporters Wednesday. 'They've been through a lot, a tremendous trauma.'","Mitchelle Blair, 35, is accused of killing her two children, Stoni Ann Blair, 13, and Stephen Gage Berry, 9, in a house of horrors.

34,"Theresa May has asked advisers to examine whether files alleging abuse by senior figures in the 1980s were ever passed to the security services . Theresa May made the extraordinary admission that there ‘might have been a cover-up’ of an Establishment paedophile ring by the Home Office in the 1980s. The Home Secretary’s comments came after the publication of a report into how her department handled papers relating to alleged Westminster child abusers. NSPCC boss Peter Wanless and Richard Whittam QC had tried to track down 114 files that went missing in the Home Office. Just one was found; another was shredded by the Ministry of Justice, which took possession of the dossier, just three years ago. The men concluded: ‘It is ... not possible to say whether files were ever removed or destroyed to cover up or hide allegations of organised or systematic child abuse by particular individuals because of the systems then in place. 'We cannot say that no file was removed or destroyed for that reason.’ Their report also revealed the list of names which officials were asked to search under when looking for the missing files – suggesting possible links to the so-called Dickens dossier. It included known paedophiles such as Cyril Smith and members of the Paedophile Information Exchange, which campaigned to legalise sex with children. It also featured senior political figures such as former Home Secretary Leon Brittan, Labour peer Lord Janner, and two Tory grandees, Sir Peter Morrison and Sir Peter Hayman, who are both now dead. Police have questioned Lord Brittan and searched Lord Janner’s home in recent months, but neither has been charged. In a statement to MPs, Mrs May said of the latest findings: ‘It doesn’t prove or disprove the Home Office acted appropriately in the 1980s.’ She added: ‘There might have been a cover-up.’ However, contradicting the Home Secretary and the findings of the report, David Cameron said on the campaign trail in Rochester that ‘conspiracy theorists’ would have to ‘look elsewhere’. He added: ‘I think it is important that [the report] says there was not a cover-up.’ Last night, Mr Wanless said his comments were ‘wrong’. The new report centred on the work of late Conservative MP Geoffrey Dickens, who wrote to Lord Brittan in 1983 to say he would expose eight public figures suspected of child abuse unless action was taken. Lord Brittan has said in a statement that he ‘told Mr Dickens that I would ensure that the papers were looked at carefully by the Home Office and acted on as necessary’. The files were never published. Earlier this year, amid revelations in the Mail about Smith and the PIE, it emerged that the Dickens dossier had gone missing, along with a string of other documents. NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless has carried out a review into Home Office handling of historic allegations of child abuse . Former Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens (left), who died in 1995, said he gave details of Establishment paedophiles – known as 'Dickens dossier' – to then Home Secretary Leon Brittan (right) in 1983 . After an initial review by the Home Office found they could not be traced, Mrs May appointed Mr Wanless and Mr Whittam to conduct a full trawl across Whitehall.

36,"Scientists are poised implement decades of study to give vision to the blind if a new bionic eye is approved by the FDA. In January, the Food Drug Administration was supposed to approve the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System by California developer Second Sight, now those in the U.S. who would qualify for the device wait with bated breath as February roars on. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A new vision: A California company hopes to soon get approval for its retinal implant that could give sight back to thousands . A first of its kind technology, the Argus II was already approved for use in Europe in 2011 and is the culmination of 20 years of scientific research into the delicate and deeply complex sight organ. The implant and eyewear duo will most benefit patients with an inherited form of degenerative blindness that destroys the retina called retinitis pigmentosa, which affects about 3,000 people in the U.S. New eyes, new life: One day Elias Konstantopoulos (left, with grandson Anthony) hopes to see his families faces again with the help of the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System (on Konstantopoulos, right) Sufferers of the disease experience a gradual retinal generation and an accompanying loss of vision that eventually leads to blindness. By implanting a series of electrodes inside the eye, the Argus II prosthesis will make up for the failing retina by itself transmitting information about lightness and darkness, for instance, to the brain. A second aspect of the Argus II is the eyeglass headset. Patients wear eyeglasses mounted with cameras that then transmit data about what is in front of them to a small wearable computer. Cyborg eye: a tiny set of electrodes become an electronic retina, as seen in this close-up . Form there, the information is . transmitted wirelessly to the implant and the brain is sent a series of . electrical impulses the patient . eventually learns to interpret as light, dark, and shapes. ‘No . one really thought it would be possible because the tissue around the . eye is so soft and delicate,’ Dr. Mark Humayun, of the Keck School of . Medicine at USC told the Wall Street Journal. ‘If . we continue to develop this type of technology and begin to understand . the new electrical language of pulses to the brain, to the eye, we can . apply it to other parts of the body and we can change our world and how . we relate to it,’ continued Dr. Humayun, who has been working on the . technology for 25 years and is co-creator the Argus II. Seeing the future: Lead reseachers believe the device will once day allow the blind to see color and even have their vision zoon, like like an iPhone . One early patient, Elias Konstantopoulos of Glen Burnie, Maryland, had . lost his sight completely to retinitis pigmentosa and sought help from . the Argus II researchers. After undergoing the implantation in 2011, Konstantopoulos was able to distinguish between dark and light and used that ability to help him maneuver through space. His hope is to one day see the face of his grandson, Anthony. Neither Konstantopoulos nor any of the other recipients of the Argus II in the U.S. and Europe thus far are able to see completely normally. However, researchers say some of the Argus II recipients are able to identify letters just a few inches tall. Dr. Humayun says the device's reliance on an external computer is key to its future success and usefulness. ‘Software upgrades will allow us to do more for people – because the implants don’t need to change, the glasses can be enhanced with software upgrades.’ Humayun sees a future where thanks to his device, once-blind patients will see in various colors and even, he says, in digital zoom, just like ‘your iPhone.'","The Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System is a new implant that could give the blind vision.

37,"One of Michael Jackson's friends who testified that he was not molested by the pop superstar has now changed his story as he fights for money from Jackson's estate. Wade Robson, one of the top music choreographers who has worked with Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, got to know Michael Jackson decades ago when he began going for sleepovers at the Neverland Ranch. The now-30-year-old Robson is changing his tune, however, as he filed legal requests for financial compensation from the singer's estate for 'childhood sexual abuse'. Scroll down for video . Fanboy: Wade Robson, seen here at age 7, grew close to Jackson when he was a child and frequently slept over the star's infamous Neverland Ranch . The legal motion, which has been filed under seal so it is not available to the public, comes years after Robson made repeated public statements defending Jackson and denying any wrongdoing. New story: Wade Robson, seen here in 2008, reportedly filed legal papers on May 1 claiming that Jackson's estate should pay him money for childhood sexual abuse . The two met when Robson was five years old and Jackson was in his late 20s or early 30s. They bonded over a love of music and he repeatedly slept over his house and spent nights in the same bed as the much-older singer. Robson played a pivotal role in the 2005 trial, when Jackson faced 14 counts relating to child molestation and conspiracy to molest minors. He was found not guilty on all of the charges, and Robson was one of the star witnesses who defended Jackson, saying that he was never inappropriately touched or molested. A similar defense was given by their mutual friend Macaulay Culkin, who also slept over the singer's ranch over a long period of time. In the past eight years, Robson has made a name for himself in the entertainment world, becoming one of the most sought-after choreographers. He has worked with Usher, Britney Spears, and NSYNC. His name hit the gossip columns in 2002 when Britney Spears' relationship with Justin Timberlake ended after she allegedly cheated on the NSYNC star with the choreographer. Since then, Robson has worked on the show So You Think You Can Dance, and is currently in charge of Demi Lovato's choreography. Synched stories: Though Robson testified at Jackson's 2005 trial that he was never molested by the singer (both seen outside of the courtroom), the papers his legal team just filed suggest otherwise . New gig: Robson has made frequent appearances on So You Think You Can Dance as a guest judge . But now, TMZ is . reporting that they heard from unidentified legal sources that Robson's . legal team filed papers asking for an undisclosed sum from the Jackson . estate on May 1. No other details about the filing have been released, . but they reportedly give an explicit detail of the alleged assault. News of the filing comes the same day as the late singer's autopsy report revealed that Michael Jackson tattooed his lips pink, permanently inked his eyebrows and relied on a dark tattoo to blend his hairline into his wig. As the high profile trial of the singer's tour promoter, AEG, continues, a disturbing photograph of the fallen pop star's corpse was shown to the court on Monday by Dr Christopher Rogers. His coroner's report described a man . whose struggle to hide a skin pigmentation disease forced him to mask . his true features but who would have lived a long life had he not . overdosed on propofol.

38,"Volte face: Sue Marsh campaigned against cuts before taking a £75,000-a-year job with the firm used by the Government to reform disability benefits . A leading campaigner against welfare cuts who claimed to be too sick to work has taken a £75,000-a-year job with the firm used by the Government to reform disability benefits. Sue Marsh, a darling of the Left who has railed against Iain Duncan Smith’s reforms for the last five years, has been recruited by Maximus, the US company that has taken over a controversial ‘fitness for work’ test for benefit claimants. Her extraordinary volte face has shocked and infuriated supporters, who have branded her a ‘Judas’ and a ‘sell-out’. Mrs Marsh said she had undergone an ‘enormous - almost cosmic - mindset shift’ that had led her to accept a job as the company’s new ‘head of customer experience’. She had previously claimed that in Maximus, the Department for Work and Pensions had sought out the ‘worst provider they could find’ to assess claimants of disability benefits. Mr Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, welcomed Mrs Marsh’s decision to jump ship and take a lucrative position with the firm. ‘I would be the first person to congratulate anyone who gets a job. I'm sure there will be some whose negative attitudes to our reforms mean they will criticise her move. They should be ignored,’ the minister told the Daily Mail last night. Mrs Marsh ran a blog which she called the ‘Diary of a Benefits Scrounger’, detailing her own efforts to be declared unfit for work because of Crohn’s disease, an inflammatory bowel condition. She was eventually placed into the ‘support group’ for employment and support allowance, the main sickness benefit, which is for people judged e unable to work or even to attend interviews. She was an architect of the Spartacus campaign, which produced a series of reports accusing the Government of cruelty and incompetence in its efforts to cut the welfare bill and was championed on Twitter by supporters including Lord Prescott, Alastair Campbell, Stephen Fry and Billy Bragg. Mrs Marsh appeared at the Labour Party’s annual conference in 2013 and wrote regularly for the Guardian. Announcing her new job, she admitted she had ‘agonised’ about how to tell her supporters of her decision. Late last year, Maximus was awarded a three-and-a-half year contract to take over delivery of the ‘work capability assessment’ – the test of claimants’ ability to work -- from the much-criticised Atos Healthcare. Mrs Marsh insisted said she was motivated only by a desire to improve the system. ‘Those who doubt my intentions and goals and those with different goals to mine will almost certainly be critical, and, in a sense, I understand that response. If I didn't know me I might be sceptical too,’ she added. Mrs Marsh said her own, successful application to be declared eligible for sickness benefits had been ‘threatening and scary’. But she insisted: ‘It is not inherently a good thing for support group numbers to be high. If some of those people who qualify would actually rather like to work, but are terrified of an intimidating and farcical system of support, that actually leads to a life of fear of change,’ she said. ‘We are coming up to an election period. There will be a hiatus and a time to breathe and take stock. There is a new provider, Maximus… If there was ever a time to get significant and valuable changes to what now seems universally accepted to be a system that is in serious need of better delivery, it is now.’ Fans: Mrs Marsh was championed on Twitter by supporters including Alastair Campbell (L) and Stephen Fry . She said Maximus had given her ‘fairly free rein to devise a strategy to bring about a wide range of improvements to the service from a customer perspective’. ‘Of course there are considerable benefits to both myself and Maximus in this development. I will be giving the same 300 per cent passion and commitment to them that I have been giving to campaigning. ‘Crucially, it's a campaigner's job to change things, not just to make a lot of noise. Whilst I have to make an enormous - almost cosmic - mindset shift to take this direction, Maximus also have to bring me into their trust and with very little to go on. ‘Someone is going to do it. I can do it, with all of my knowledge and personal experience of what is wrong with the system at the moment.’ One correspondent on Mrs Marsh’s website wrote: ‘I am so sorry to say this but I feel betrayed so much I can only now call you Judas.’ Sue Marsh is a darling of the Left who railed against Iain Duncan Smith’s (above) reforms for the last five years . Another former supporter, Peter Farrington, said: ‘Sorry, I have to add my name to the list sickened by this decision. So sickened in fact I don't even want to try to explain why I find this a betrayal of the trust so many of us placed in you in recent years, Sue.’ Tony Cyphus branded Mrs Marsh a ‘sell-out, just like all the MPs who go on to work for the multinationals’. ‘So what happened to ""I'm in so much pain I can't work, please give me DLA [Disability Living Allowance]”? I can't wait to see how much of a hypocrite you turn out to be. And be aware you have just marked yourself for a life of hate from people who really are true victims of this and future governments,’ he added. Another activist wrote: ‘You've proudly displayed photos of yourself bed and hospital bound, yet it seems an offer of [reportedly] £75k per annum plus benefits has healed you. You've gone straight from the support group to full time employment - you truly are a modern day miracle. IDS's prayers have been answered.’ A spokesman for Maximus said: 'We believe, given her experience, that Sue will be able to contribute a great deal in making the customer experience of work capability assessments a better one.'","Sue Marsh, a darling of the Left, has been recruited by Maximus.

39,"As the financial crisis hit in 2008, she spoke for the nation when she asked a group of economists: ‘Why did nobody notice?’ Four years on, the Queen finally got her answer – although it didn’t seem much to her liking. The monarch was visiting the Bank of England in Threadneedle Street yesterday when she was buttonholed by one of its financial policy experts. Scroll down to watch . Golden look: Her Majesty examines the stacks of gold bars stored in the Bank's vaults . Royal inspection: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were shown the vaults at the Bank of England where thousands of gold bars are kept . Sujit Kapadia said he wanted to put . her mind at rest after she famously described the credit crunch as . ‘awful’ during a visit to the London School of Economics in 2008. At the time, she asked academics how the onset of the crisis could have been missed when it was so enormous. Yesterday Mr Kadapia told her that it . was partly because financial crises, like flu pandemics and earthquakes, . are hard to predict. People, she was also informed, got complacent because they thought the risk was being managed better than before. The Queen grimaced at this and said: ‘But people had got a bit...lax, had they?’ Usually, she is notoriously discreet about her views on international events. But, remarkably, the Queen went on to . suggest that the Financial Services Authority may not have been . aggressive enough in its policing. She said: ‘The Financial Services – . what do they call themselves, the regulators – Authority, which was . really quite new … it didn’t have any teeth.’ Hands-on: The Queen thoroughly inspects the gold vaults during her visit to the Bank of England . Value: The vaults contain thousands of bars of gold worth billions of pounds . The Duke of Edinburgh didn’t help matters much, asking: ‘There’s not another one coming, is there? He then fixed Mr Kapadia and his group with a typically gimlet eye and barked: ‘Don’t do it again!’ Afterwards Mr Kapadia was optimistic . as he assessed the encounter, saying: ‘It was a real pleasure to be able . to offer some explanation. I think she recognised that these things are . very difficult and it’s not a straightforward exercise. ‘The strongest thing I got [from the Queen] is what are we trying to do so it doesn’t happen again.’ The FSA, which is being disbanded . after failing to spot the financial crisis which engulfed Britain, later . issued a stiff response to the Queen’s remarks. It said: ‘We’ve widely acknowledged . that the regulatory approach before the financial crisis in 2008 was . flawed and has since been completely changed.’ It was the Queen’s ninth visit to the . Bank. On her first, as the 11-year-old Princess Elizabeth, she signed a . thousand pound note. Interesting discussion: The Queen was taken with the discussion on how another downturn could be prevented, while the Duke joked with the Bank's staff . Reason why: The Queen spoke to Sujit Kapadia who explained why the financial crisis wasn't foreseen . During yesterday’s visit, she and . Prince Philip were each given the honour of each signing a £1million . banknote, known as a ‘giant’ by staff. As she scribbled her signature next to the 1937 note, she muttered: ‘It hasn’t improved, really.’ On their tour, the Queen must have . been a little over-awed by the £27billion worth that glittered in the . Bank of England’s basement vault. Visit: A large crowd had gathered outside the Bank as the Royal couple toured inside, which included an inspection of bank notes . It’s one of nine vaults dotted around London, in which the Bank stores around £200billion of gold. This one contains 63,000 gold bars stacked in eight rows. Each four-tonne stack is four pallets high, and each pallet carries 80 bars. While, at 13kg – around 2st – a gold . bar is a little heavy to steal, the Duke of Edinburgh did seem tempted . by the £1million banknote he was asked to sign. He joked ‘is this just lying about?’, adding ‘you won’t miss it, will you?’. Signature: The Queen and the Duke each signed a £1 million bank note to go into the guest book . Afterwards the Governor of the Bank, . Sir Mervyn King, thanked the Queen for her visit, describing the Bank’s . staff as ‘unsung heroes’ who had kept the economy going ‘in the most . difficult circumstances’. And he asked the Queen for two early . Christmas presents. One was her signature on the banknote, and the other . was the Royal Assent on the Financial Services Bill. ‘When is the Bill due?’ The Queen . asked. ‘It has gone through Parliament and should be with you before . Christmas,’ Sir Mervyn replied.

Killer: The story Google has denied ever deleting relates to the 2007 conviction of paedophile Ronald Castree, 61, (left), for the murder of Lesley Molseed, 11 (right) in 1975 . Lesley's father Fred Anderson (pictured) said: 'He hasn’t got the right to be forgotten - it’s terrible' Lesley had walked to the shop from her home in Delamere Road, Rochdale, pictured, when she was abducted . The ruling by European judges gives . people the right to have 'inadequate' and 'irrelevant' results about . them wiped from the web, which led to the search engine being bombarded . with requests. The article about the conviction of Castree, 61, is just one of thousands Google has removed from search results and just one of numerous MailOnline articles affected by the ruling. A story about a millionaire banker blamed for helping cause the global financial crisis was among the first to be hidden as was an airline accused of racism by a Muslim job applicant. However, a spokesman from Google early Saturday said that while the article HAD been removed from some search results it was NOT at the request of Ronald Castree. And he said the request had been granted to someone else mentioned in the article but that the story would still appear if Castree was used at the search term. Under the right to be forgotten rule, stories are not entirely deleted by Google, rather they simply will no longer appear if a certain search name is used. The spokesman refused to say who had asked for the article to be removed and thus granted the right to be forgotten. The body of Lesley Molseed being removed from the windswept moor where Castree left it in October 1975 . Castree, a book dealer and married father of one, snatched Lesley off the street near her home in Rochdale as she went to buy bread for her mother in October 1975. He had been on the way to visit his wife and her new baby in hospital. Castree killed Lesley in a frenzied attack, stabbing her 12 times, once through the heart, before leaving her body on a lonely moor in West Yorkshire. He then kept quiet when an innocent man, Stefan Kiszko, was tried, convicted, sentenced and served 16 years for a crime he did not commit. The real killer was only captured in 2006 when a DNA sample Castree had given in relation to an attack on a prostitute in 2005 was found to be an exact match for sperm found on Lesley's underwear. In 2007, he was found guilty of murder at Bradford Crown Court and told he would not be considered for parole until 2037, by which time he will be 84. He attempted to appeal his conviction in 2008, but was rejected. Jim Killock, Executive Director of Open Rights Group, said: 'It is deeply problematic that a private company can make decisions about things that get censored, as they will end up making mistakes.' The BBC's economics editor, Robert Peston, was affected by the ruling when he had a 2007 blogpost about the former Merrill Lynch boss Stan O'Neal excluded from some search results. He said today of the MailOnline's story: 'It does not seem to be in the public interest for the ""right to be forgotten"" to be applied to stories such as this one.' Paedophile convicted of Lesley Molseed murder - after evading justice for 32 years . Original article that was published by MailOnline on 16 November 2007. Lesley Molseed was abducted and stabbed to death by Ronald Castree in October 1975 . Ronald Castree, 54, will serve a minimum of 30 years for what the judge called 'a truly dreadful crime', adding that he accepted the killer would probably die in jail. Lesley Molseed, from Rochdale, was abducted and killed in 1975, in a case which resulted in one of Britain's most notorious miscarriages of justice. Her body was found on Rishworth Moor in West Yorkshire and Stefan Kiszko, a lonely misfit, confessed to the crime under duress. He was jailed and served 16 years before he was cleared in 1991 when it emerged that sperm samples taken from her clothes could not have been his, as he was infertile. He died the following year. Forensic scientists used new techniques to produce a DNA profile in 2000. And last year they found that Castree, who had given a sample after being arrested in 2005 on another matter, was a one-in-a-billion match. Court records also showed that days before Mr Kiszko stood trial, Castree had abducted a nine-year-old and subjected her to an indecent assault which led to a conviction. At the murder trial, Castree tried to have this conviction kept from the jury. He also argued that the sample from Lesley's clothes must have innocently become contaminated with his DNA. But the jury at Bradford Crown Court was not taken in. Mr Justice Openshaw told Castree, a trader in comic books: 'You kept quiet whilst an entirely innocent man was arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced for this murder.' Lesley's mother April Garrett, left, said justice had been done when Castree was convicted of her daughter's murder - not before innocent man Stefan Kiszko, right, spent 16 years in jail for a crime he did not commit . Afterwards Lesley's mother, who has reverted to her maiden name, April Garrett, said: 'We are relieved that after so long our quest for justice for Lesley is now over.' He appeared to all the world as a caring father - and a hard-working, self-made man. But for 32 years, Ron Castree lived with a terrible secret. Behind his respectable facade, he was a paedophile and serial sex attacker who eventually progressed to child murder. While his wife and her baby were in hospital in 1975, Castree snatched Lesley Molseed off a street in Rochdale as she went to buy bread for her mother. He drove the 11-year-old, who had learning difficulties, to a windswept moor, sexually assaulted her and stabbed her to death in a 'frenzied' attack. To read the full story click here . The EU's ‘right to be forgotten’ legislation allows European citizens to request that links to ‘inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant’ information be removed from Google search results. In short, Google must remove articles if the impact on the individual’s privacy is greater than the public’s right to find it, the European Union Court of Justice found. The landmark case that led to the new legislation was brought by a Spanish man who complained that an auction notice of his repossessed home on Google's search results infringed his privacy. Since the legislation was introduced in May, Google has said it has received more than 120,000 requests from across Europe ranging from serious criminal records, embarrassing photos and negative press stories. An online form was launched to allow EU citizens to ask for personal data to be taken down. The form requires links to the material the person wants removed, their country of origin, and a reason for their request. Individuals also have to attach a valid photo identity. Google then assesses each request individually, before deciding whether to remove information from search results. Since May, MailOnline has had several articles taken down. Among the most high profile articles removed was one from May 2009 describing the captivity in which Josef Fritzl kept his family. It has also included a September 2010 article about multi-millionaire Tory MP Jonathan Djanogly, who admitted hiring private eyes to spy on his local party members.

41,"Created: . 17:51 GMT, 16 May 2014 . A New York man has been sentenced to life in prison without parole Friday for raping a girl and killing her mother after cutting off his ankle monitor last year. David Renz learned his fate in Onondaga County Court after a judge said he hoped the penalty would comfort the victims' family. The 30-year-old had pleaded guilty to first-degree murder, admitting that he carjacked Liverpool librarian Lori Ann Bresnahan and her 10-year-old daughter March 14, 2013. Justice served: David Renz, 30, pictured entering Judge Thomas Miller's courtroom Friday, was sentenced to life in prison without parole for raping a girl and killing her mother . Divine judgement: Judge Thomas Miller warned Renz that one day he will face 'another judge' who will impose a much harsher sentence . Renz stabbed and strangled the mother as she tried to stop him from raping her daughter. He had been under federal monitoring on child pornography charges but cut off his ankle GPS. Renz was sentenced earlier this year to 30 years in federal prison for possessing more than 11,000 images and 1,100 videos of child pornography. On Friday, Renz remained motionless and wore a blank expression on his face as his sentence was being read. Innocent victim: Lori Ann Bresnahan, a school librarian from Liverpool, New York, was kidnapped along with her daughter by Renz last March and stabbed to death while trying to prevent her attacker from raping the 10-year-old . Judge Thomas Miller had some harsh words for the defendant, whose behavior last March he characterized as 'despicable,' Syracuse.com reported. ‘One day, you will face another judge. One day when you pass from this earth, another judge will impose a harsher sentence for the absolute evil you committed,’ he said. Some of the slain librarian’s family members read their impact statements from the stand before the sentencing as Renz's relatives sat in the audience. ‘Nothing, absolutely nothing, prepares you for such a tragedy in your own family,’ Bresnahan's cousin Jim O'Hara said. O'Hara, a former reporter with The Post-Standard, vividly described in his six-page handwritten statement the moment he found out that his relative had been brutally murdered, saying that he felt as cold 'as the most brutal of winter days.' Kathleen Renz, the convicted killer’s mother, spoke to reporters after her son's sentencing, saying that she prays every day for Lori Bresnahan and her daughter. Mrs Renz added that she was relieved to learn that federal prosecutors will not seek capital punishment for her son. 'It's a great burden lifted,' the mother said. The victim’s family pleaded with officials not to hold a death penalty trial to spare Bresnahan’s daughter additional trauma. Spared: Renz, pictured here in 2013, will not face the death penalty because the victim's family said they do not want Bresnahan's daughter to testify against him in court . The shocking murder of Lori Breshnahan - and . the rape of her young daughter - occurred while Renz was awaiting trial . for the child pornography charges, and was confined to his home and . required to wear a monitoring device. On March 14, 2013 - just six weeks . after he'd been arrested for possessing child pornography - Renz removed . his required electronic monitoring device and drove to the Great . Northern Mann in Clay, New York, a suburb of Syracuse. Heartless: Renz, seen here in a mugshot, remained expressionless as his sentence was being read . Once at the mall, Renz parked his car . and walked around the parking lot, where he found Breshnahan - a school . librarian - and her daughter getting into their vehicle. Renz then forced his way into Breshahan's car using an air pistol he claimed was a real gun and forced her to drive to a remote area of the mall's parking lot where he bound both of his victims and - using a knife to cut a hole in her clothes - raped the young girl. Prosecutors said Renz was trying to . use cable ties to bind the woman to a headrest in her car when she . fought back and shouted for the girl to bolt from the vehicle. As the girl ran off and was rescued . by a passing motorist, her mother was strangled and repeatedly stabbed . in the head and chest, officials said. Renz was captured by police . shortly after. Weeks after the attack, a report by a . federal judge found that the officers failed to do monthly checks on . Renz that would have included inspection of the bracelet. Federal . probation officers in Syracuse who were monitoring Renz were fired or . demoted. Renz pleaded guilty to the murder and rape charges last year. Authorities say that several of the . child pornography videos found in Renz's possession depicted acts . similar to the rape and murder for which Renz pleaded guilty. 'Let . the defendant's other victims not . be forgotten,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Lisa Fletcher said during Renz's . child pornography sentencing hearing in March, according to Syracuse.com. 'Each and every child in each and every one of . the defendant's 11,000 images and 1,100 videos for which he stands . convicted, every single one of those children was used by David Renz to . fuel his twisted interest in the exploitation of children. Every one of . them is also his victim.' Fletcher . asked for a sentence of 30 to 70 years, and asked that any sentence the . judge imposed would run consecutively with whatever sentence Renz gets . for Breshahan's murder. Perp walk: The attack happened two or three weeks after Renz acquired cable ties and an air pistol they said was used to threaten the woman into stopping in a suburban Syracuse mall parking lot . Monster: David Renz, 30, pleaded guilty to charges of murder, rape and kidnapping in connection to a deadly carjacking of a woman and her daughter . Crime scene: New York State Police investigate a car involved in a fatal carjacking on Verplank Road, Clay, N.Y . Renz's attorney, Assistant Federal . Public Defender Randi Bianco, asked for a sentence within the sentencing . guidelines of 19 to 24 years, citing the difficult life Renz has . suffered as the result of a facial deformity. Renz was born without the lower half of his left jaw and part of his cheekbone - a hereditary condition that would come to dominate his and his family's lives. The man's father, brother and sister all had the facial deformity but it was more pronoucnded in him, requiring multiple jaw-lengthening surgeries that drained his parents' already limited resources. In school, his friends recalled that Renz had to cover the hole in his neck from a tracheotomy so he could be heard, drawing bewildered stares from his classmates. Those who knew him as a child described Renz as a bright kid who loved computers and was good at math, science and social studies, but he was also a loner who was always picked last for athletic  activities and group work.

The images - pixelated because they are so horrific - show shot, stabbed and burned bodies piled in the streets of the village of Baniyas. Among the victims are a number of children, some no more than toddlers. Scroll down for video . In May, photographs were released of bodies lying in a street in Baniyas after more than 140 people died in a sectarian massacre by pro-Assad forces in Baniyas and Bayda . Massacred: This image provided by The Syrian Revolution against Bashar Assad reportedly shows dead bodies at Bayda village, where scores of people were allegedly killed by regime forces . Bodies lying inside lying inside a house in Bayda were shown in a YouTube video after two days of slaughter in May . Some were lying in pools of blood, and one toddler was covered in burns, her clothes singed and her legs charred. Some of the women victims were mutilated. April 2011: More than 70 protesters killed as security forces fire on crowds in Deraa and Damascus. December 2011: Activists say more than 100 army defectors killed over two days in Idlib province. May 2012: Some 108 killed in Houla, near Homs - UN later blames Syrian troops and militia. August 2012: Witnesses and activists say at least 300 killed as government forces storm Darayya, a Damascus suburb. January 2013: At least 100 people killed and burned in their homes in Haswiya, near Homs. At least 77 people - 20 from the same family - were killed, a day after 72 died in nearby Bayda after it was overrun by government forces. Assad's regime claimed it had fought back against 'terrorist' groups' and restored peace and security to the area. But activists have posted harrowing video . clips online to back up their claims that pro-regime militia known as . the Shabbiha are involved in the operation. The BBC's correspondent Jim Muir claims there is a strong sectarian dimension to the killings. Baniyas is a Sunni Muslim pocket in the middle of a large Alawite enclave on Syria's Mediterranean coast, and activists in the area accuse militias loyal to Assad of ethnic cleansing. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights documented the names of at least 50 dead in Bayda. There were reports of men's bodies, some blindfolded, lying in the street. The Observatory, which relies on a . network of activists on the ground, cited witnesses as saying that some . of the victims were killed with knives or blunt objects and that dozens . of villagers were missing. The massacre began following clashes with Assad forces who had earlier arrested villagers and killed them in prison after torture. A survivor named as Abu Abdullah told the Sunday Telegraph: 'Security and Shabbiha militia entered the village with knives and guns and started to kill everybody they met. 'Almost 60 per cent of the women and children of the village were killed.' Lifeless: Lying sprawled on the ground, the body of a man killed when Syrian regime forces overran the village of Bayda. The image was taken from a video. His face has been pixelated because of his injuries . Conflict casualties: Two bodies lying in the village of Bayda - said to be victims of militia loyal to President Assad . Hundreds of Sunni families are now fleeing the area, heading for nearby towns like Jableh and Tartou. But Rami Abdelrahman, head of the Observatory said: 'Now the army is turning people back at the checkpoints outside the town, telling them to go back to Baniyas, that nothing is wrong. 'There are also announcements going out on mosque loud speakers telling people to return home.'","Images show victims of massacre in Baniyas village.

In an extraordinary assault on the Prime Minister’s authority, 50 coalition MPs joined Labour in voting against a watered-down Government motion supporting the ‘principle’ of military action. There were shouts of ‘resign’ from the Labour benches as the result – 285 votes to 272 – was announced to a shocked House of Commons. Scroll down for video .

Syria, and to recall Parliament from its summer recess for an emergency . debate, backfired spectacularly. Mr Cameron had been counting on . Labour’s support to ensure he could win a Commons vote authorising . strikes, despite the doubts of scores of Tory MPs. Labour, . however, refused to back the Government, prompting the angriest foreign . policy row between the main parties since Suez in 1956. The Tories . accused Ed Miliband of giving ‘succour’ to President Bashar Assad’s . regime. Defence Secretary . Philip Hammond said: ‘I’m disappointed with Ed Miliband’s behaviour, . frankly. Anything that stops this from giving a clear, united view of . the British Parliament will give some succour to the regime.’ After . the vote, Mr Hammond said: ‘I hope Britain isn’t going to retreat into . being the sort of nation that isn’t going to act to uphold international . norms.’ Sir Gerald . Howarth, a former defence minister who voted ‘reluctantly’ with the . Government, accused Mr Cameron of rushing into the vote. Reza Afshar, head of the Syria team at the Foreign Office, tweeted simply: ‘Disaster.’ Senior US officials said President Obama was prepared to move ahead with a limited military strike despite last night’s vote.

Moment: MPs last night dramatically voted against David Cameron's plea to take military action against Syria . Recall: Mr Cameron told a packed House of Commons that Britain had to decide how to respond to 'one of the most abhorrent uses of chemical weapons in a century' Demonstrate: Protesters speaking out against military action in Syria stand outside the Houses of Parliament . Last . night’s vote is a grave humiliation for Mr Cameron and will also raise . doubts about the future of the ‘Special Relationship’ between Britain . and the US. One Whitehall source said Britain was ‘handing back its . deputy sheriff’s badge’ to Washington.

Target: Syria's President Bashar al-Assad (centre left) pictured yesterday during a meeting with a Yemeni delegation in Damascus . He admitted there was not ‘one . smoking piece of intelligence’ but insisted it was ‘beyond doubt’ that . Assad’s regime was responsible for a chemical attack that killed at . least 350 civilians. Mr . Miliband insisted he was not ruling out backing military strikes at some . point, but presented his own ‘sequential roadmap’ before he thought . Britain should take such a step. Asked if Mr Miliband was giving comfort . to Assad, a Downing Street spokesman said: ‘Yes. The fact is that a lot . of the arguments over this could give succour to the regime.’ No . 10 also accused Mr Miliband of ‘flipping and flopping’ and having . privately indicated his party would back military intervention before . moving the goalposts at the last minute. Making their point: Protesters demonstrating against military action in Syria stand outside the Houses of Parliament in Westminster, central London . Placards: A protester demonstrating against military action in Syria outside the Houses of Parliament in London . Opposition: As MPs debated the UK response to the Syria crisis, protestors gathered outside the Commons . Anger: Anti-war protesters have staged a number of demonstrations in Westminster this week .

Cameron acknowledged voters were sceptical about getting into ‘another . war in the Middle East’ but insisted he was not proposing a long-running . campaign to dislodge Assad – rather a strike on ‘command and control’ assets to try to reduce the chances of another chemical weapons attack. A . string of senior Conservatives, however, expressed doubts about the . wisdom of intervention and Mr Cameron’s rush to join the US. Former Tory . leadership contender David Davis said: ‘It’s very simple – when you are . going to do things which will lead to the death of people, civilians in . particular, you should get your facts right first.’ Campaign: UKIP leader Nigel Farage (left) and his deputy Paul Nuttall launched this poster opposing Britain intervention in Syria . Condemnation: Mr Farage said David Cameron's policy on Syria was his 'gravest misjudgment yet' Lord Dannatt, former head of the British Army, said he did not support military intervention in Syria in any shape.

Sales of Candle In The Wind, the song performed by Sir Elton John at the Princess of Wales’s funeral, raised an incredible £38 million for charity. The star’s performance moved mourners and millions watching the service on TV and became the fastest-selling single in history. The recording sold more than 33 million copies. Sir Elton generously donated his royalties to the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund. It will close on New Year’s Eve having raised a total of £138 million, money that has been used to fund more than 400 projects close to Diana’s heart. The Princess was famed for her charity work, particularly raising the plight of AIDS victims. She also campaigned for a ban on landmines during a high-profile visit to Angola. John Bechard, the memorial fund’s accountant, said: ‘When Diana died there were thousands of donations pouring in, but they were mostly around the £5 and £10 mark. 'The proceeds from Candle In The Wind gave us a remarkable chunk of money which massively raised the fund’s profile, triggering a snowball effect. We are indebted to Sir Elton for his generosity.’ Ownership of the fund will now pass to the charitable foundation set up for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge  and Prince Harry.

45,"Revolution: Gene therapies can change a person's DNA . Regulators yesterday approved the first therapy in the western world that can correct errors in a person’s genetic code. Europe has approved Glybera to be used against a rare inherited disorder which disrupts fat production in the body. The treatment uses a virus to counteract LPLD, lipoprotein lipase deficiency, which can led to acute inflammation of the pancreas. The illness affects around one or two people per million and sufferers have damaged copies of a gene which is essential for breaking down fats. The virus infects muscle cells with a copy of a healthy gene and a one-off treatment is effective. The treatment was backed by an advisory panel to the  European Commission in July and full approval was granted  yesterday. The medicine should be available next year. Professor John Kastelein, of the University of Amsterdam, said the therapy would have a  ‘dramatic impact’ on patients. Only two other gene therapies have previously been approved for sale, both in China. It will cost around £1 million ($1.6 million) per patient, a new record for pricey modern medicines. Joern Aldag, chief executive of Amsterdam-based uniQure, said more such treatments would follow and argued a high price was justified because gene therapy restored natural body function and was not just a short-term fix. 'This provides higher benefit to patients than the classical protein replacement strategy and this is why we think we should be fairly and adequately compensated,' he said in a telephone interview on Friday . Patients with LPLD, which affects no more than one or two people per million, are unable to handle fat particles in their blood and are at risk of acute and potentially fatal inflammation of the pancreas. The approval follows a positive recommendation from the European Medicines Agency in July. Glybera treats the genetic disorder lipoprotein lipase deficiency (LPLD) by altering sufferers' DNA. LPLD affects about one in a million people, leaving them without a vital gene that breaks down fat particles in their blood. It means fat builds up in the blood leading to abdominal pain and life-threatening inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). The only other way to manage the disease is by having a very low-fat diet. The therapy uses a virus (pictured) to infect muscle cells with a working copy of the gene. The privately owned firm is now working with governments on potential pricing strategies, which are likely to vary from country to country, ahead of the commercial roll-out from the second half of 2013. Aldag said some countries preferred the idea of a one-off payment at the time of treatment but others were interested in an annuity system, which would probably involve charging around £200,000 a year for five years. That kind of annual charge would put Glybera in a similar price range to expensive enzyme replacement therapies for other rare diseases, such as Cerezyme for Gaucher disease from Sanofi's Genzyme unit. UniQure is also preparing to apply for regulatory approval for Glybera in the United States, Canada and other markets. The idea of treating disease by replacing a defective gene with a working copy gained credence in 1990 with the success of the world's first gene therapy clinical tests against a rare condition called severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). People with SCID - also known as 'bubble boy disease' - cannot cope with infections and usually die in childhood. The field then suffered a major setback when an Arizona teenager died in a gene therapy experiment in 1999 and two French boys with SCID developed leukaemia in 2002. In China, Shenzhen SiBiono GeneTech won approval for a gene therapy drug for head and neck cancer in 2003 but no products have been approved until now in Europe or the United States. More recently, some large pharmaceutical companies have also been exploring gene therapy. GlaxoSmithKline, for example, signed a deal in 2010 with Italian researchers to develop a SCID therapy.","Glybera is the first gene therapy approved in the Western world.

46,"A video showing what is thought to be first ever 3D-printed bullet being fired has appeared on YouTube. In the video, from user Taofledermaus, three bullets of different weights and shapes are fired at various targets using a Mossberg 590 shotgun. According to the video, each plastic pellet has been 3D-printed. A small lead shot was then added to give the bullet weight. In the YouTube video, uploaded by Taofledermaus, three different 3D-printed bullets are fired at various targets. The first bullet, pictured, weighed four tenths of an ounce. A small lead shot was added to each bullet to give it weight as it travels through the air . Each of the three 3D-printed bullets were loaded into shotgun casing and fired using a Mossberg 590 gun. In this screenshot, the shooter - YouTube user JackIsMyCopilot - is shown loading the bullets into the gun . Earlier this week a working plastic gun, printed using a self-assembled 3D printer, a nail and some household screws, successfully fired nine shots. The gun, based on blueprints made available online by Defense Distributed last month, cost just $25 (£16) to make and fired the .38 caliber shots by the Wisconsin engineer who built it. Up until now, the blueprints for the 'Liberator' gun have been mainly printed using industrial-grade 3D printers that cost around £5,250 ($8,000). This latest gun is one of the first to be 3D printed using the much cheaper Lulzbot A0-101 3D printer - a printer that can be bought online, assembled at home and costs £1,136 ($1,725). Because the gun is made entirely from plastic it makes it possible to carry the gun through airport security metal detectors, for example, without being found out. Earlier this month, the Mail On Sunday tested this theory by smuggling a version of the Liberator gun onto a Eurostar train. In the video, Taofledermaus is heard saying: 'You've heard of a 3D-printed gun? How about 3D-printed bullets.' He goes on to explain that YouTube user ArtisanTony printed a 'couple of shotgun pellets' with the first weighing about four tenths of an ounce. Taofledermaus adds that a small piece of lead shot is added to the casing to give the bullet enough weight to travel and pierce the target. Each pellet took an hour to print and is fitted into a traditional shotgun case. In the video, YouTube user JackIsMyCopilot is shown firing the first bullet using a Mossberg 590 shotgun aimed at a dartboard, perched above a wooden table in a field. The bullet goes through the dartboard, and through the plastic cans its resting on. In . a second experiment the pair are shown firing another bullet, this time . weighing five tenths of an ounce, at a block of wood with a target on . it. The second bullet fired in the YouTube video weighed five tenths of an ounce. It also had a small lead shot added and was fitted to a shotgun casing. This bullet was nicknamed the Red Rocket . The Red Rocket 3D-printed bullet was fired at a target attached to a plank of wood. The wood was rested up against a wooden table. The bullet appeared to bounce off the plank, yet when the Taofledermaus inspected the wood he discovered it not only pierced the plank, (pictured) it also pierced the wooden table behind it . This second bullet, nicknamed in the video as the Red Rocket, had a honeycomb-design with strips of plastic. In the video, the bullet hits the target but doesn't appear to pierce it, instead it looks as if the bullet bounces off. Taofledermaus goes on to explain the reason the Red Rocket . didn't pierce the wood is because of the 'stability problem that's . common with a bullet not shot through a rifle barrel.' Adding 'It goes on the path of least resistance, and this path is usually sideways' and this is known . However, when Taofledermaus examines . the piece of wood he finds that the bullet not only pierced the plank of . wood, but it also pierced the wooden table holding the plank of wood . upright. He's heard saying: 'That's amazing. I didn't expect that. That was pretty awesome. 'Even though it hit sideways, it still went through.' A third bullet with three points on the end, nicknamed the 'Tri-Factor round', is then shown being fired at a polystyrene mannequin head on the wooden table. The bullet hits the top of the head, knocking it off the table, but then ricochets off behind. The third 3D-printed bullet, nicknamed the Tri-Factor because it has three points on the end, was fired in the YouTube video at a polystyrene mannequin head . The Tri-Factor bullet performed the weakest of the three 3D-printed bullets. It hit the polystyrene mannequin target before bouncing off sideways. This may have been because the head was knocked off the table, due to its light weight, before the bullet could penetrate . Earlier this week a working plastic . gun, printed using a self-assembled 3D printer, a nail and some . household screws, successfully fired nine shots. The gun, based on blueprints made . available online by Defense Distributed last month, cost just $25 (£16) to make and fired the .38 caliber shots by the Wisconsin engineer who . built it.

48,"He was hundreds of miles from civilisation, lost in the burning heat of the desert. Second World War Flight Sergeant Dennis Copping took what little he could from the RAF Kittyhawk he had just crash-landed, then wandered into the emptiness. From that day in June 1942 the mystery of what happened to  the dentist’s son from Southend was lost, in every sense, in the sands of time. Shifting sands: The final resting place of the Kittyhawk P-40 has been discovered in the Sahara 70 years after it crashed there . Time capsule: Aside from the damage it sustained during impact, the aircraft appears to have been almost perfectly preserved in the sands of the Sahara . Chance discovery: The single-seater aircraft was found by a Polish oil company worker exploring a remote region of the western desert in Egypt . But 70 years later, the ghostly remains of his battered but almost perfectly preserved plane has been discovered. Like a time capsule that could provide . the key to his disappearance, it had lain intact alongside a makeshift . shelter Dennis appears to have made as he waited, hopelessly, for . rescue. Now a search is to begin for the . airman’s remains – as aviation experts and historians begin an operation . to recover and display the P-40 aircraft in his memory. The chance find was made by an oil . worker exploring a remote region of the Western Desert in Egypt. It is . more than 200 miles from the nearest town in a vast expanse of largely . featureless terrain. Flight Sergeant Copping, part of a . fighter unit based in Egypt during the North Africa campaign against . Rommel, is believed to have lost his bearings while flying the damaged . Kittyhawk to another airbase for repair. All that is known is that he . went off course and was never seen again. At the controls: The plane's cockpit, but there are fears over what will be left of it after locals began stripping parts and instruments for souvenirs and scrap . Unseen and untouched: Equipment and controls from the plane were found scattered around the craft at the crash site. The plane is still in very good condition . Intact: Most of the plane's cockpit instruments were untouched and it still had it guns and ammunition before they were seized by the Egyptian military for safety reasons . Remarkably, the plane remained almost . untouched for the next seven decades – right down to the guns and . ammunition found with it. Most of the cockpit instruments are intact, . and the twisted propeller lies a few feet from the fuselage. Crucially, the P-40’s identification plates are untouched – allowing researchers to track its provenance and service history. There is flak damage in the fuselage, . which is consistent with documents on the aircraft. Historian Andy . Saunders said: ‘It is a quite incredible time capsule. It’s the . aviation equivalent of Tutankhamun’s tomb. ‘This plane has been lying in the same spot where it crashed 70 years ago. ‘It hasn’t been hidden in the sand, it has just sat there. ‘He must have survived the crash . because one photo shows a parachute around the frame of the plane and my . guess is the poor bloke used it to shelter from the sun. The radio and . batteries were out of the plane and it looks like he tried to get it . working. Second World War weaponry: The machine gun on the wing of the crashed plane. It appears the pilot got into trouble and brought it down in the middle of the desert . Bullet holes: The Kittyhawk appears to have been shot at (left), while its broken propeller lays nearby (right). Historians have described the find as the 'aviation equivalent of Tutankhamun's Tomb' Well-preserved: The Kittyhawk's magazine of bullets were also found in the wreckage. The radio and batteries were discovered out of the plane . ‘If he died at the side of the plane . his remains would have been found. Once he had crashed there, nobody was . going to come and get him. It is more likely he tried to walk out of . the desert but ended up walking to his death. It is too hideous to . contemplate.’ The RAF Museum in Hendon, North . London, has been made aware of the find and plans are already under way . to recover it before anyone tries to strip it for scrap or souvenirs. Efforts have also been made to trace any immediate members of Flight . Sergeant Copping’s family in the UK, but it is believed that none . survives. Captain Paul Collins, British defence . attaché to Egypt, confirmed a search would be mounted for the airman’s . remains but admitted it was ‘extremely unlikely’ it would be successful. The spot could be marked as a war grave after the aircraft is . recovered. Heading home: The RAF Museum at Hendon, north London, has been made aware of the discovery and plans are underway to recover the aircraft for exhibition in the future . Sign of the time: The Kittyhawk's factory stamp (left) and gun loading instruction panel (right). However, some locals see the aircraft as a piece of junk . Signs of survival: Flight Sergeant Dennis Copping's parachute was part of what is believed to be a makeshift camp alongside the fuselage . Remote: The crash site is about 200 miles from the nearest town. No human remains have been found but it is thought the pilot's decomposed body may lay anywhere in a 20 mile radius of the plane . Captain Collins added: ‘The scene is close to a smuggling line from Sudan and Libya. ‘We will need to go there with the Egyptian army because it is a dangerous area.’ Ian Thirsk, of the RAF Museum, confirmed staff are working with the MoD to recover the plane. The P-40 was a US-made fighter and . ground attack aircraft. It was outclassed by later German fighters and . saw little combat in Europe but performed a key role in North Africa . and Asia where high-altitude performance was less critical.

49,"In his youth: Sydney Swift (pictured as a Lance Sergeant), who helped bury Rifleman Horace Savage, wants his fallen comrade exhumed and re-buried . For seven decades Sydney Swift believed the soldier he buried in a battlefield after his death in front of him was given a proper military funeral and headstone in a cemetery. But when the 95-year-old British Lance Sergeant’s friends visited the Catania War Cemetery in Sicily, Italy, they could not find any memorial for Rifleman Horace Savage. The soldier was first buried in unmarked graves along with Rifleman Edwin Pearton and Lance Corporal John Biggs, close to where the three men fell during World War Two in July 1943. After the war, the bodies of Rfn Pearton and LCpl Biggs were exhumed and they were given a military funeral and headstone at the Sicily cemetery. It had been presumed that Rfn Savage was also re-buried there after a funeral following his death at Primosole Bridge in Catania, which preceded the mainland Allied Invasion of Italy. So when friends told Mr Swift they were visiting the cemetery, the great-grandfather asked them to leave flowers on the grave of Rfn Savage. But they found no headstone for the soldier. This prompted an investigation by Mr Swift, who found his fallen comrade’s name on the Cassino Memorial at the Cassino War Cemetery in Frosinone. This site is 370 miles from Sicily on mainland Italy and lists more than 4,000 Commonwealth soldiers who took part in the Italian campaign but whose graves are not known. Fallen: After the war, the bodies of Rifleman Edwin Pearton (grave left) and Lance Corporal John Biggs (right) were exhumed and they were given a military funeral and headstone at the Catania War Cemetery in Sicily, Italy . Now, despite the passing of seven decades, Mr Swift said he can pinpoint to within a few yards the location of the grave he placed the serviceman in with the help of a stretcher bearer. With the London Irish Rifles Regimental Association’s backing, he is urging Italian authorities and the Commonwealth War Grave Commission to now bury Rfn Savage with full military honours. They also want to trace the family of Rfn Savage, who was in the 1st battalion London Irish Rifles. Mr Swift, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, said: ‘Last year friends of mine were going to Sicily and asked them to look up the three men killed in action at Primisole Bridge in Catania. ‘They came back and said they had only found two graves. We researched his name and realised it was on the Cassino Memorial as “no known grave”. Nowhere to be seen: When the friends of British Lance Sergeant Sydney Swift visited the Catania War Cemetery in Sicily, Italy, they could not find any headstone for Rifleman Horace Savage . Site: It had been presumed that Rfn Savage was also re-buried at the Catania War Cemetery after a funeral following his death at Primisole Bridge in Catania, before the Allied Invasion of Italy, but his grave is not there . ‘Well, I know where his grave is . because I buried him in a ditch that we were holding as a position. It . was the only time I have buried somebody in my life. I am hardly likely . to forget it. The successful push into Italy began in Sicily in July 1943, which led to the collapse of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini's government. The Sicily invasion, which faced relatively little resistance, was the beginning of the Allied invasion of Axis-controlled Europe. Allied forces made it into mainland Italy by September that year, landing in the south, and the Italians agreed to surrender. But the Germans set up huge defensive lines to block any push north, and the Allied attack proved to be long-running and costly. However the Allies managed to break through and captured Rome in June 1944, two days before D-Day in Normandy, France. Germany's forces in Italy surrendered on May 1945, six days before the whole country did so. ‘I put a . marker on the grave. He must still be there. The Commonwealth War Graves . Commission have told me that if a body is discovered they can arrange . for a proper burial and a headstone. ‘Somebody needs to go and find him for that to happen. He needs a proper burial and proper grave.’ The . three men were killed when a 16-man patrol was sent out towards high . ground in Catania to make contact with the Germans. As they neared the . enemy line German machine guns opened up. Mr . Swift and a stretcher bearer recovered a mortally-wounded Rfn Savage . and carried him back to a dressing station 400 yards away, where he died . a few minutes later. Mr Swift said: ‘The men had been mown . down by machine gun fire and Savage had been shot. Two stretcher bearers . were told to recover him but one of them was too frightened so I went. ‘The Germans were very fair and didn’t . fire on us and allowed us to bring Savage back to the ambulance. He was . in a lot of pain and was delirious. Attack: Scenes during the Allied Invasion of Italy in World War Two, as British troops pick their way through the ruins of the Italian village of Cassino, where Rfn Savage is commemorated on a memorial . 'We couldn’t do anything for him and . he died at the ambulance. We buried him out of sight in the ditch. 'The Germans were very fair and didn’t fire on us and allowed us to bring Savage back to the ambulance. He was in a lot of pain and was delirious. We couldn’t do anything for him and he died at the ambulance. We buried him out of sight in the ditch' Sydney Swift on Rfn Horace Savage . ‘I . was very upset as he was a friend and it was probably due to the trauma . that I forgot to take his identity tags and personal possessions of . him. I think he had a ring on his finger. I don’t know why he wasn’t . found.’ Details of where dead soldiers ended up were often recorded contemporaneously in the regimental war diaries. After the fighting had moved on or even . after the war had finished the Commonwealth War Graves Commission . located as many men as possible and buried them in local war cemeteries. But due to the ‘fog of war’, the records were sometimes missing or incomplete and many men were forgotten about. Successful mission: File pictures of the Sicily invasion in 1943. The three men were killed when a 16-man patrol was sent out towards high ground in Catania to make contact with the Germans . London Irish Regimental Association spokesman Nigel Wilkinson said: ‘Mr Swift believes that he can still locate Savage’s grave and desperately wants to see his comrade buried beside his friends before he dies. It is right that he should be properly buried.’ Peter Francis, of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, said: ‘If a set of remains were discovered and confirmed to be a Commonwealth serviceman they would be presented to us for proper burial. We would mark the grave and care for it.’","Rifleman Horace Savage was killed in action in Catania, Italy, in 1943.

50,"Private Lewis Curtis has finally been buried in the Netherlands almost 70 years after he was killed in action in WWII . A British soldier has finally been buried in the Netherlands almost 70 years after he was killed in action in the Second World War, and nine years after his remains were found. Private Lewis Curtis, from Liskeard, Cornwall, who served with 5th Battalion The Wiltshire Regiment, was laid to rest at the Arnhem-Oosterbeek War Cemetery in a funeral with full military honours today. Pte Curtis’s remains were found in an unmarked field grave by builders clearing the way for a new housing estate, but it took five years to identify him using forensics. His family, including his great nephew Rifleman Richard Edwards, 20, who has just returned from Afghanistan with 5th Battalion the Rifles - the Wiltshire Regiment’s successors - were at the funeral. Pte Curtis, who survived the Normandy landings, was killed aged 19 in the Netherlands in an artillery barrage during Operation Market Garden on October 2, 1944. He was buried in a shallow grave where he fell, but the markers for the plot at De Laar Farm were washed away when German military engineers flooded the area. His burial site was lost, and his family believed he had died in Belgium. Six decades after his death, in 2003, his remains were unearthed by builders excavating the old Dutch battlefield to make way for a new housing estate. Since then, a Dutch forensic team has been using scientific tests including DNA analysis to try to discover who he was. Pte Curtis, who served with 5th Battalion The Wiltshire Regiment, was laid to rest at the Arnhem-Oosterbeek War Cemetery in a funeral with full military honours today . His family, including his great nephew Rifleman Richard Edwards (pictured), 20, who has just returned from Afghanistan with 5th Battalion the Rifles - the Wiltshire Regiment's successors - were at the funeral . It was only after old dental records were uncovered in 2008 that Pte Curtis’s identity was revealed. Warrant Officer Class 1 Geert Jonker, the head of Recovery and Identification Unit for the Royal Netherlands Army, said the lengthy process to confirm remains is not unusual. 'It can take anything from three days to seven years to be able to identify remains because it’s important to get it right for the next of kin,' he said. 'So when we can make a positive identification, it makes all those years of research worthwhile. It’s the ultimate reward, but sometimes it is about luck. 'In this case it was only because we went for a second opinion on the age of the soldier that told us he was a lot younger than we originally thought. 'Lewis had an undiscovered growth defect that would not have caused him any problems but made his remains seem older than his 19 years. Pte Curtis was laid to rest in Oosterbeek today close to where he was killed in action nearly 70 years ago . Pte Curtis, who survived the Normandy landings (above), was killed aged 19 in the Netherlands in an artillery barrage during Operation Market Garden on October 2, 1944 . Members of Pte Curtis's family lay a wreath at his funeral . The young soldier was buried in a shallow grave where he fell, but the markers for the plot at De Laar Farm were washed away when German military engineers flooded the area . 'Based on that information, we had seven new names we were considering - three of whom had dental records. One of which was Lewis, who was a perfect match.' Pte Curtis’s sister Alice died 20 years ago but her children, Susan Wilbourne and Robert Cole, who are in their 50s and still live in Liskeard, grew up with tales of their Uncle Lewis, and flew to the Netherlands for the burial. 'Mum was always talking about Lewis, so it’s unbelievable to be here now to finally lay him to rest after so long of not knowing,' said Mrs Wilbourne. 'It’s been quite an emotional rollercoaster since we found out. A horn is sounded at the cemetery. It was only after old dental records were uncovered in 2008 that Pte Curtis's identity was revealed . Allied paratroopers touch down in the Netherlands during 1944's Operation Market Garden . 'It is just such a pity that Mum couldn’t be here to bury her little brother, but I can feel her here. She was always very close with Lewis.' The pair buried their uncle with a glass marble - one of the few keepsakes their mother had of her young brother. 'It feels right to return it to him,' Mr Cole added. To this day, 18 soldiers of the old Wiltshire Regiment are still unaccounted for, an Army spokeswoman said, and some lie buried in unnamed graves marked 'Known unto God' in Allied War Cemeteries in Oosterbeek and Nijmegen. Mr Jonker and his identification team continue to try to trace their identity to help their families.

53,"Finally found: The body of Derek Allen, pictured aged 20, has been discovered in an unmarked grave 71 years after his death . He took to the skies above northern France as the Nazi Blitzkrieg was unleashed across Europe. It was May 10, 1940, and at the controls of his Hurricane aircraft, young Flying Officer Derek Allen’s brief but heroic war had begun. Eight days later, the 22-year-old Second World War fighter pilot was dead. But in his short blaze of glory, the RAF ace was awarded a gallantry medal, shot down twice and credited with four outright and three shared enemy kills. He died after his plane was shot down over farmland, but because his body was never officially recovered, he was listed as missing in action, presumed dead, for seven decades until historian Andy Saunders began researching his case. He discovered the young pilot had been removed from his wrecked plane on May 18 by locals and buried in the village of Poix-du-Nord, near Cambrai. Now his younger brother Richard Allen is preparing to lead family members at a dedication service later this year when a new headstone with FO Allen’s name on it will replace an anonymous one erected by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Mr Allen, an 81-year-old retired stockbroker from Great Shefford, near Hungerford, Berkshire, said yesterday: ‘It is a great relief to know what did happen to Derek and where he ended up after all these years. ‘We are grateful to Andy for finding this out and it means an awful lot that the family have at last a grave to visit so we can pay our respects.’ Flying squad: Derek Allen's squadren sits for an official photograph in a hanger in Essex, before being sent to France . Rest in peace: Fighting Officer Allen's younger brother Richard Allen, 84, can finally pay his respects at his brother's grave . FO Allen, one of three brothers from Leicester, signed up with the RAF in 1937, aged 18, and joined No 85 Squadron a year later. At the outbreak of war, the squadron . moved to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force, and the . young airman’s first action came on May 10, 1940, as Germany launched . its Blitzkrieg across France and the Low Countries. Unmarked grave: Derek Allen's war grave in the village of Poix-du-nord near Cambrai, Northern France, will soon be replaced with a headstone with his name engraved on it . During his first airborne skirmish, . he shot down a Henschel reconnaissance plane and was credited with . playing a part in bringing down a Junkers 88 warplane. The next day he shared two kills – . both Dornier bombers – and on May 13 he single-handedly shot down two of . the Luftwaffe’s Heinkel fighters. He was posthumously awarded the . Distinguished Flying Cross for bringing down a Junkers 87 dive bomber on . May 15 that had been wreaking havoc on British armour during the Battle . of France, which was to lead to the Dunkirk evacuation later that . month. In the same action, FO Allen’s Hurricane was hit by anti-aircraft fire, forcing him to bail out. His citation for the DFC read: ‘After . his aircraft had been severely damaged by anti-aircraft fire he didn’t . hesitate to attack a Junkers 87 over enemy territory and shot it down.’ After spending 24 hours walking . through enemy territory to get back to his base, the exhausted airman . was spotted falling asleep while sitting eating his dinner. On May 17 he took off for the final time and his war ended when he was shot down and killed. With France being overrun by the Germans, local records detailing the discovery of his body were not meticulously maintained. It was only after historian Mr . Saunders began his investigation five years ago that he found a witness . account of a Hurricane crashing near Cambrai on the same day FO Allen . went missing. Lost at war: The telegram sent to Derek Allen's family with the message that Derek was missing after a battleon May 17th, 1940 . Happier times: Derek Allen, aged 17, holds his younger brother Richard's hand, aged three, while on a family holiday before the war .

54,"Many saluted, some cried and a few held signs. But for 70 miles, hundreds of people paid their respects to a Second World War airman who died in combat in the South Pacific almost 70 years ago and was finally returned to his upstate home on Friday. Funeral director Vincent Locovozzi, who escorted Sergeant Dominick Licari's remains from the Albany airport to the small town of Frankfort, said there was 'only one word that describes this: unbelievable'. 'He's a man who has been dead longer than most people have been alive, but he's a hero coming home,' Mr Locovozzi said. Homecoming: A flag-draped coffin, containing the remains of Sergeant Dominick Licari, arrives in Albany . Veterans groups, businesses and residents lined a 10-mile stretch of the Mohawk Valley to pay tribute to Licari as his remains made the journey home. Honor guards from Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion chapters were posted along Route 5 as the vehicle procession carrying his casket left the New York State Thruway at Little Falls and traveled to Frankfort, west of Albany. A commercial flight carrying Licari's casket arrived at the Albany airport, and military pallbearers carried the casket from the plane to the hearse on Friday evening, Mr Locovozzi, a distant relative of the fallen airman, said. Licari's brother and sister, and several nieces and nephews, were at the airport to accompany his casket home, with the Patriot Guard motorcycle riders providing an escort. 'It's great to bring him back after all these years because you never leave anyone behind,' Fred Schultz, the post commander, told Times Union. War hero: Licari, pictured right with other airman, died after his plane crashed as he returned from a bombing mission in Japan . Guard of honor: As the coffin was carried from the plane those greeting it saluted . At Melrose Market, the windows facing the street were decorated with American flags and a sign that read: 'Thank you and Welcome Home Sgt. Dominick Licari'. Organizations and business owners along Route 5 also posted signs in Licari's honor. Lost: Licari's remains were only identified this year, after his fatal crash in 1944 . 'We just thought it would be a nice . tribute for him for giving his life for our country,' grocery store . owner Linda LaValla said. 'It's good to know that they take the time years later to find our servicemen and bring them home. It's closure for everybody.' Clint Whittemore, of Chatham, was among those who gathered inside the airport to watch Licari's homecoming. He said he came to support Licari's family, just as others had turned out when his uncle, airman Ken Scripter, was shot down and killed over Germany in 1943. Mr Whittemore said found closure after his family tracked down the uncle's grave  ten years ago. 'To be able to identify the remains means a lot. I know it meant a lot to my mom,' he said. Licari was a 31-year-old gunner on board . a two-man Army Air Force A-20 Havoc bomber that crashed into a . jungle-covered mountain in Papua New Guinea on March 13, 1944, while . returning from a bombing raid on a Japanese airfield. The pilot, 2nd Lieutenant Valorie Pollard, of Monterey in California, also was killed, along with four airmen in two of the mission's other A-20s, which slammed into the mountain in bad weather. Licari, one of nine children, was officially declared dead in 1946. Last month, U.S. military officials notified his two surviving siblings that his remains and those of Pollard had been found and identified. Pride: Ex-servicemen and residents lined the route from the airport as Licari was finally returned home . Licari's funeral and burial, with full military honors, is expected to be held in Frankfort on Tuesday. Governor Andrew Cuomo directed flags on state government buildings to be flown at half-staff on Tuesday to honor Licari. Pollard's burial arrangements are pending, a Pentagon official said.","Sergeant Dominick Licari died in 1944 after his plane crashed in Papua New Guinea.

55,"A mother who began sprouting thick facial hair after the birth of her son 28 years ago says she's feeling sexier and more confident than ever before, having finally stopped trying to get rid of her beard. The German-born woman, identified only as Mariam, appeared on ITV's This Morning to discuss why she stopped tweezing the hair on her face which she had been plucking every day for almost two decades. Mariam, 49, also explained to Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield that she is happy with the way she looks and would not change her situation, despite being criticised for her behaviour by her own mother. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Dating turn-off: Facial hair may be a no-no for single American guys, but German woman Mariam, 49, who has been growing a beard since 2008, insists that it is sexy . She also said she is able to look past the comments of internet trolls who target her bearded woman blog to tell her 'people like me should be sent to Russia... or shot'. Mariam - who has had tests to rule out serious medical problems more associated with excessive hair growth in women - told Phil and Holly, along with expert Dr Carol Cooper, that she had never had any facial hair before the birth of her son, after which it gradually began growing. Ten years on, the hair was growing thick enough for a full beard, and Mariam would laboriously tweeze out each hair every morning. 'I asked my mother what to do and she told me to tweeze them, never to shave or wax. And then I visited my gynaecologist who said it happened to lots of other women so I shouldn't worry. But they didn't really give me a reason. Now I know it must be inherited . 'My chin got really red and inflamed from all the plucking, and some of the hairs were ingrown, so it always looked like I'd fallen on my chin. But when people asked what had happened and I told them they couldn't believe it.' In 2008, when she was living alone and unemployed, Mariam decided to give her beard a chance to grow. She said: 'I had no job so I had free time to give it a chance and see what happened, so I started a blog to inform other women about it, and to see what was happening every day and how I felt. Mariam explained to Holly and Phil that prior to her 'experiment' plucking her beard had become an obsession, and that her son, who has not been named, used to remember it taking her hours to leave the house. She added: 'I thought about it all the . time. I had to double check before leaving the house that it was OK, . and take a mirror in my pocket. That was life. 'When . I decided to let it grow it didn't feel brave, it was more like a . curiosity. I wanted to see hwat would happen to me. There was a big fear . that everyone would turn away and nobody would talk to me anymore.' Mariam, 49, appeared alongside Dr Carol Cooper on ITV's This Morning to explain her situation to Holly and Phil . And Mariam did meet some resistance - from her family. 'My . mum said ""do you have to shock people like this"". Then she got used to . it and thought that one day I'd finish it, and was patient, but now . she's getting nervous and wants me to stop and become ""normal"".' She received negative reactions from . other people, too, especially on the internet: 'People can be cruel . depending on where you go. 'Some people say people like me should be sent . to Russia or shot, but that's just one person on the internet writing . horrible stuff. Other people say it's courageous and inspiring. So there . are both sides.' Mariam now travels with a circus as the bearded lady act, which she says she enjoys since she has studied acting in the past and also likes educating people about the issue. She said: 'I want to give people the opportunity to talk to a bearded lady, because usually they are too scared in the street.' Mariam, who has been single for a decade, also says she is looking for a relationship now that she is feeling sexy and more confident. She told Holly that even if she could she would not change her situation. Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield asked Mariam how she felt about having a beard . 'I know myself more now,' she said. 'There are always people with a fetish who might only be attracted by the beard, but that is the same with lots of things, even if I were a blonde woman. 'I tried electrolysis three times but it just grew back -  and now I'm happy with it. It is sometimes annoying when I go shopping but otherwise it has given me other opportunities. Dr Cooper explained that it is fairly common for women to have facial hair they do not want, but if it comes on suddenly - especially if accompanied by other symptoms such as weight gain and irregular periods - you should see your GP since it could be to do with excessive of androgen hormones. What causes excess facial hair? It's estimated that one in ten women suffers from excess facial and body hair. But what causes it? 'Sometimes race or just a family tendency to be more hairy is to blame, rather than any medical problem,' explains Dr Rina Davison, an endocrinologist from Whipps Cross University Hospital, London, with a special interest in excess hair. 'People of South Asian or Mediterranean descent tend to have more hair than Caucasians or those with black skin, for example. It's also possible to be quite a “hairy” family regardless of race.' But there are other factors that could be to blame. Women normally produce low levels of male hormones called androgens, but an excess can trigger unwanted hair growth known as hirsutism. A common cause of hirsutism is Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, which has accompanying symptoms of acne, weight gain and irregular periods. Other, rarer, causes include a tumour on the ovary or adrenal gland as well as certain medicines including steroids. Rarely, a woman will have normal androgen levels and the cause of the unwanted hair growth will not be identified.","Mariam, 49, has been growing a beard since 2008.

57,"A 5-year-old Kansas girl died on Friday after her mother's boyfriend allegedly kidnapped her and engaged in a shootout with police officers. The sequence of events began about 7:30 pm on Friday when Cadence Harris of Leavenworth was reported kidnapped, police said. Police said there was some relationship between the child and her abductor but would not provide details. The suspect, however, has been identified by local news stations as 30-year-old Marcus McGowan. He was reportedly dating the girl's mother, Christie Harris. Victim: Cadence Harris, 5, died on Friday after her mother's boyfriend allegedly kidnapped her and engaged in a shootout with police officers . Suspect: Marcus McGowan, pictured, allegedly kidnapped Cadence on Friday night. He was reportedly in a relationship with her mother, Christie Harris . Scene: At some point the suspect got out of his vehicle and pointed a gun at officers and they exchanged fire, police said . 'The matter unfolded quite rapidly,' said Leavenworth Police Chief Patrick Kitchens, calling the girl's death tragic. 'We are still trying to sort out specifically what happened.' Police in both Missouri and Kansas were involved in a chase as the suspect crossed the state line before the incident ended in the northeast Kansas town of Leavenworth. At some point the suspect got out of his vehicle and pointed a gun at officers and they exchanged fire, Kitchens said. 'Anytime we have the loss of a small child it is devastating,' Kitchens told a news conference, adding that officers on the scene had tried to revive the girl. He said it was not clear if the child was shot by her abductor, who was seriously wounded and is hospitalized in Kansas City. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation (KBI) was called in to help investigate. Stressing that the probe only just getting under way, KBI Special Agent in Charge Mark Malick said it did not appear the girl was hit by bullets fired by police officers. Mother: Christie Harris, Cadence's mother, said that McGowan has previously abused her . Brother: McGowan's brother Andree McGowan has said he is 'up and down like a roller coaster' because of his brother's alleged behavior . 'Evidence we have at the scene at this time does not support any indication that gunfire struck the car or the victim, and specifically gunfire coming from law enforcement,' Malick said. An autopsy was being carried out and would not be completed on Saturday, he told reporters. Christie Harris, Cadence's mother, said McGowan has a history of domestic violence in an interview with 41 Action News. She also told the station that McGowan was under the influence of drugs. 'He's hurt me before lots of times, but he's never hurt her,' she told the affiliate station. 'He's never even spanked her. 'She was perfect, she was beautiful, she was smart, she was perfect,' Harris also said. McGowan choked Harris in 2009 and was convicted twice in 2011 for domestic battery, the Atchison Globe reported. McGowan's brother Andree McGowan told KCTV5 he is 'having emotions' and is 'up and down like a roller coaster' because of his brother's alleged behavior. 'It's testing our [family's] togetherness,' he also told the station. 'It's testing our will to stay together. Is it going to break us up or make us stronger?'","Cadence Harris, 5, was reported kidnapped on Friday night.

58,"Deaths from cuts and grazes, diarrhoea and flu will soon be common as antibiotics lose their power to fight minor infections, experts have warned. The World Health Organisation says the problem has been caused by antibiotics being so widely prescribed that bacteria have begun to evolve and develop resistance. It claims the crisis is worse than the Aids epidemic – which has caused 25million deaths worldwide – and threatens to turn the clock back on modern medicine. Antibiotic resistance needs to be taken as seriously as AIDS was in the 1980s, experts say . The WHO warns that the public should . ‘anticipate many more deaths’ as it may become routine for children to . develop lethal infections from minor grazes, while hospital operations . become deadly as patients are at risk of developing infections that were . previously treatable. Doctors . are increasingly finding that antibiotics no longer work against . urinary and skin infections, tuberculosis and gonorrhoea. The . WHO is urging the public to take simple precautions, such as washing . hands to prevent bacteria from spreading in the first place. Doctors . are also being told to prescribe antibiotics sparingly and ensure . patients finish the full course, as if they stop mid-way the bacteria . may become resistant. In England last year some 41.7million . prescriptions were written out, up from 37.2million in 2006. MRSA - Patients infected with MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) are 64 per cent more likely to die than those with a non-resistant form of S. aureus. People infected by resistant superbugs are also likely to stay longer in hospital and may need intensive care, pushing up costs.C. difficile - This bacteria produces spores that are resistant to high temperatures and are very difficult to eliminate. It is spread through contaminated food and objects and can cause blood poisoning and tears in the large intestine. E. coli - this now accounts for one . in three cases of bacterial infections in the blood in the UK and a new . strain is resistant to most antibiotics. It is highly contagious and . could cause more than 3,000 deaths a year. Acinetobacter Baumannii - a common bacteria which is resistant to most antibiotics and which can easily infect patients in a hospital. It can cause meningitis and is fatal in about 80 per cent of patients.CRKP - this is a bacterium that is associated with extremely difficult to treat blood infections and meningitis. It is resistant to nearly all antibiotics and is fatal in 50 per cent of cases.Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis is estimated to kill 150,000 people globally each year. NDM-1 - a bacteria detected in India of which some strains are resistant to all antibiotics. Dr . Keiji Fukuda, the WHO’s assistant director for health security, said: . ‘Without urgent, co-ordinated action, the world is headed for a . post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and minor injuries which . have been treatable for decades can once again kill. ‘Effective . antibiotics have been one of the pillars allowing us to live longer, . live healthier, and benefit from modern medicine. ‘Unless . we take significant actions to improve efforts to prevent infections, . and also change how we produce, prescribe and use antibiotics, the world . will lose more and more of these global public health goods and the . implications will be devastating. ‘We should anticipate to see many more deaths. ‘We are going to see people who have untreatable infections.’ Only . last month, Britain’s chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies . criticised GPs for needlessly ‘dishing out’ antibiotics to patients. In . the largest study of its kind, the WHO looked at data from 114 . countries on seven major types of bacteria. Experts are particularly . concerned about bacteria responsible for pneumonia, urinary tract . infections, skin infections, diarrhoea and gonorrhoea. They are also . worried that antiviral medicines are becoming increasingly less . effective against flu. Dr . Danilo Lo Fo Wong, a senior adviser at the WHO, said: ‘A child falling . off their bike and developing a fatal infection would be a freak . occurrence in the UK, but that is where we are heading.’ British . experts likened the problem to the Aids epidemic of the 1980s. Professor Laura Piddock, who specialises in microbiology at the . University of Birmingham, said: ‘The world needs to respond as it did to . the Aids crisis. ‘We . still need a better understanding of all aspects of resistance as well . as new discovery, research and development of new antibiotics.’ The . first antibiotic, penicillin, was developed by Sir Alexander Fleming in . 1929. But their use has soared since the 1960s, and in 1998 the . Government issued guidelines to doctors urging them to curb . prescriptions. Nonetheless, surveys suggest they are still prescribed . for 80 per cent of coughs, colds and sore throats. The spread of deadly superbugs that evade even the most powerful antibiotics is happening across the world, United Nations officials have confirmed. Image shows the superbug MRSA which already kills almost 20,000 people a year in Europe . Jenna and Andrew Hannon, pictured,  were distraught after losing their son Oliver to a superbug . The human cost of the rising number of superbugs is becoming all too familiar. Distraught young couple Jenna and Andrew Hannon lost their second son to an infection at a hospital neo-natal unit in Bristol. Little Oliver was born early at 24 weeks and although he had seemed well enough to go home with his parents, he soon fell dangerously ill. He was taken to Southmead Hospital but the infection had taken hold and the youngster passed away. Tragically the couple had lost another prematurely born son, Travis, to infection in 2010, just five-and-a-half hours after his birth at 26 weeks. An inquest into Oliver's death later found he had been killed by the pseudomonas bacteria. He was one of three babies in the hospital to be hit by the killer bacteria, which was later linked to baby deaths around the country. An investigation took place at the hospital into Oliver's death, but it could not find what caused his infection. The inquest was told that Oliver was being given two types of antibiotics before he died as a precaution, but neither specifically fought pseudomonas. As a result of the investigation the hospital also now uses antibiotics which more specifically target the bacteria. Jennifer Cohn of the international medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières agreed with the WHO's assessment and confirmed the problem had spread to many corners of the world. 'We see horrendous rates of antibiotic resistance wherever we look in our field operations, including children admitted to nutritional centres in Niger, and people in our surgical and trauma units in Syria,' she said. Earlier this month, Government body NICE said that one in 16 patients are developing infections on NHS wards because of poor hygiene among staff. NICE said 800 patients a day, the equivalent of 300,000 a year, are infected by a member of staff or by dirty equipment. It is estimated the infections cause 5,000 deaths annually and contribute to another 15,000. Antibiotics are substances that kill or interfere with the growth of microorganisms, especially bacteria. But not all microorganisms are susceptible to all antibiotics, according to Public Health England. Microorganisms which are not killed or inhibited by an antibiotic are called 'antibiotic resistant'. They continue to grow and multiply in the presence of that antibiotics. There are several ways in which bacteria can be resistant. Some destroy the antibiotic, for example by producing enzymes against it; some prevent the antibiotic getting into their cells; others get the antibiotic out of their cells before it can harm them. HOW DOES RESISTANCE DEVELOP? Some bacteria are naturally resistant; new resistances also arise spontaneously by chance mutations and these resistant strains then multiply. Some resistances can be passed from one bacterium to another, spreading resistance between species. Loops of DNA (called plasmids) carry the resistance genes from one bacterium to another. When an antibiotic is given, it kills the sensitive bacteria, but any resistant ones can survive and multiply. The more antibiotics are used (in animals and agriculture as well as in man) the greater will be the ""selective pressure"", favouring resistant strains - i.e. survival of the fittest. Antibiotics don't 'cause' resistance; rather, they create an environment which favours the growth of resistant varians which already exist in nature or arise by chance.","WHO says the problem has been caused by antibiotics being so widely prescribed that bacteria have begun to evolve and develop resistance.

59,"Excavation: Guido Lewandowski, a member of VBGO, digs out the remains of a German soldier at a former army headquarter in Klessin, Germany . The remains of a German soldier killed during the Second World War have been unearthed during an excavation by volunteers dedicated to giving dignified burials to the war dead. Bones and personal belongings were dug up during the excavation near the eastern German town of Klessin, which lies about 50 miles east of Berlin. The area around the small town which lies close to the Polish border was the place of a . battle between German and Soviet forces between February and March . 1945 - part of the final push into Germany known as the Battle of Berlin. As many as 200 of the soldiers who were part of the conflict are still missing . today - instigating the dig. The excavation was carried out by members of The Association for the Recovery of the Fallen in Eastern Europe who have been carrying out digs to help identify those killed in both the First and Second World Wars. Known in Germany as Vereins zur . Bergung Gefallener in Osteuropa or VBGO, the group is made up entirely . of volunteers, many of whom are from Russia, Poland, Czech Republic, . Slovakia, Ukraine and the US. Since they were founded in 1992 the group has recovered more than 7,000 sets of remains all over Europe. But due to the level of decomposition they are only able to identify around 25 per cent of those discovered. Discovery: An old German 'Wehrmacht' helmet lays on a pile of soil as members of the Association for the Recovery of the Fallen in Eastern Europe dig in Klessin . Findings: Personal belongings including glasses were also discovered during the groups most recent dig . The group have dug up the remains of a number of nationalities and they state: 'We are not looking for soldiers of the Wehrmacht, not for U.S. GI's, . Marines, soldiers of the red army or Polish Military- not for infantry . soldiers, sailors or airmen- not for good or bad. 'We are looking for people - sons, fathers, brothers.' The not-for-profit association has now carried out 100 searches since they were formed 20 years ago and now has more than 200 members. The dig in Klessin, . which belonged to a defence line during the Battle of Seelöw Heights, . was the seventh carried out this year, following excavations in Poland . and Russia. The area was defended by 800 German soldiers, against three Soviet-divisions during the war. The overall offensive saw the Germans outnumbers by almost ten to one, as a million soviet soldiers took part in the final push that hastened the end of the Second World War. Fire power: Soviet artillery bombard German positions during the battle for the Seelow Heights . It is thought there are more than 200 soldiers in unmarked graves around the small town, which was the scene of battle during the Second World War . Klessin lies around 50miles east of Berlin. when the German defences fell, it left a clear path to the capital for the Soviets . A statue in Eastern Germany that commemorates Battle of Seelow Heights . The Battle of the Seelöw Heights (fought over three days, from April 16 to 19, 1945) was a part of the one of the last assaults on large entrenched defensive positions of the Second World War, . Known as  Seelow-Berlin Offensive Operation (which lasted until May 2, 1945), this battle is often incorporated into . the Battle of the Oder-Neisse - only the . opening phase of the Battle of Berlin, which was the name given to the final push of the Soviet forces into the German capital at the end of the war. Seelow Heights was where the most bitter . fighting in the overall battle took place, but it was only one of . several crossing points along the Oder and Neisse rivers where the . Soviets attacked. Close to one million Soviet soldiers, commanded by Marshal Georgi Zhukov, attacked the position known as the 'Gates of Berlin'. They were opposed by about 110,000 soldiers of the German 9th Army, commanded by General Theodor Busse. By the end of 19 April, the German Eastern Front line had ceased to exist. All that remained were pockets of resistance, and the road to Berlin was wide open for the final assault. Four days later the capital Berlin was encircled and the Battle of Berlin entered its last stage. Within two weeks, Adolf Hitler was dead and the war in Europe was effectively over.","The Association for the Recovery of the Fallen in Eastern Europe has been digging up remains of soldiers killed in the Second World War.

60,"It roamed the countryside spreading death and terror – a giant, ferocious hell-hound with flaming eyes and savage claws. For centuries, the beast that came to be known as Black Shuck struck fear into the hearts of all who crossed its path. Just a single glimpse was enough to impart a fatal curse; the briefest encounter sufficient to suck the life from any hapless victim. Discovery: These remains of a giant dog were found during a dig among the ruins of Leiston Abbey in Suffolk . Is it him? The bones are believed to date back to the 16th century, when the legendary hell hound Black Shuck (pictured in an artist's impression) was rumoured to roam East Anglia. They show the dog was a 'large male' One thing, however, has always been . absent from the many tales of the dog-like entity and its sinister . appearances in the East of England flatlands: A single fact. Now that may be about to change with an answer to the question: Did it exist only in folklore ... or was it flesh and blood? Yesterday, . 500 years after Black Shuck first went on the prowl, archaeologists . were examining the skeleton of a 7ft long dog unearthed in the remains . of an ancient abbey. It was . discovered a few miles from two churches where Black Shuck is said to . have killed worshippers during an almighty thunderstorm in August 1577. What’s . more, it appears to have been buried in a shallow grave at precisely . the same time as Shuck is said to have been on the loose, primarily . around Suffolk and the East Anglia region. Site: The bones were uncovered in a 20-inch deep unmarked grave among the ruins of Leiston Abbey (pictured) Experts will subject the bones and surrounding material to 21st century dating techniques. But . first, the legend. The beast’s most celebrated attack began at Holy . Trinity church, Blythburgh. A clap of thunder burst open the church . doors and a hairy black ‘devil dog’ came snarling in. It . ran through the congregation, killing a man and boy and causing the . church steeple to fall through the roof. Scorch marks still visible on . the church doors are purported to have come from Shuck’s claws as it . fled. Local verse records . the event thus: ‘All down the church in the midst of fire, the hellish . monster flew, and, passing onward to the quire, he many people slew.’ Next . stop was 12 miles away in Bungay, where two worshippers were killed at . St Mary’s church. One was left shrivelled ‘like a drawn purse’ as he . prayed. Brendon Wilkins, projects director of Dig Ventures, which organised the dig, pictured, said he believed the dog could have lived around 1577 because it was buried alongside pottery fragments from the period . Ruins: Dig Ventures projects director, Brendon Wilkins, said the grave was dug partly over the foundations of what appeared to have been a kitchen area - indicating it had been created after the abbey fell into disrepair . In his 1577 pamphlet . A Straunge And Terrible Wunder, the Rev Abraham Fleming told how the . Satan-like beast came ‘running all along down the body of the church . with great swiftnesse and incredible haste, among the  people, in a . visible fourm and shape’, wringing the necks of two parishioners as they . knelt. Spookily, a later work reveals: ‘Although his howling makes the hearer’s blood run cold, his footfalls make no sound.’ Subsequent . appearances of Shuck – a name believed to derive either from an old .

An image of Black Shuck is incorporated in Bungay’s . coat of arms, and the nickname for equally legendary Bungay Town FC is . the Black Dogs. The bones of the giant dog were found during a dig among the ruins of Leiston Abbey in Suffolk . The bones . uncovered in the ruins of Leiston Abbey, Suffolk, were first found by . archaeological group Dig Ventures in a project last year.

The grave was less than 20 inches deep and unmarked. Pottery . fragments found at the same level date from the height of Shuck’s . alleged reign. Radio carbon . dating tests will now give an exact age for the bones, results that will . serve either to enhance the shaggy dog stories – or perhaps to support . the far less entertaining theory that here lies a 16th century abbot’s . beloved old hunting dog. Folklore: The legend of Black Shuck is now so popular that images of the dog have been put up across Bungay. Above, a weather vane in the town . According to folklore, Black Shuck appeared during a storm on August 4, 1577, at Holy Trinity Church in Blythburgh, about seven miles from Leiston in Suffolk. Villagers were reportedly sheltering inside the church when a huge clap of thunder caused the doors to burst open and the snarling dog crashed in. It ran through the congregation, killing a man and a boy, before the steeple crashed through the roof. The dog then fled, leaving scorch marks from its claws on the church door which are still visible today. Later the same day, Black Shuck is said to have struck again 12 miles away, killing two worshippers during a service at St Mary’s Church, Bungay, while the storm was still raging. Clergyman, . the Rev Abraham Fleming, is believed to have described the appearance of the legendary hell hound in a pamphlet written in 1577, entitled ‘A Straunge and . Terrible Wunder’. He wrote: 'This black dog, or the divel in such a . linenesse (God hee knoweth al who worketh all,) running all along down . the body of the church with great swiftnesse, and incredible haste, . among the people, in a visible fourm and shape, passed between two . persons, as they were kneeling uppon their knees, and occupied in prayer . as it seemed, wrung the necks of them bothe at one instant clene . backward, in somuch that even at a moment where they kneeled, they . strangely dyed.' Historian W. A. Dutt also wrote about Black Shuck in his 1901 book, Highways and Byways, set in East Anglia. 'He takes the form of a huge black dog, and prowls along dark . lanes and lonesome field footpaths, where, although his howling makes . the hearer’s blood run cold, his footfalls make no sound,' he wrote. The legend of Black Shuck is now so popular that images of the dog have been put up in buildings across the town - and the animal is even being . incorporated into Bungay’s coat of arms. There is also a Black Dog Running . Club and a Black Dog antiques shop, while the nickname for the town's football club is 'The Black Dogs'. And the legend has even infiltrated popular culture - with British rock band The Darkness featuring a track inspired by the devil dog on their debut album, Permission To Land. The track, named 'Black Shuck', includes the lyrics: 'In a town in the east, the parishioners were visited upon by a curious beast. 'And his eyes numbered but one and shone like the sun, and a glance beckoned the immediate loss of a cherished one.'","The remains of a giant dog were found in the ruins of Leiston Abbey.

61,"A sketch of the bizarre creature that terrorized Van Meter in 1903 based on eyewitness accounts . A bizarre legend and unsolved mystery which has haunted a small Iowa town for more than 100 years is the subject of a new book called The Van Meter Visitor. For several nights in 1903, the small town of Van Meter, Iowa was terrorized by a giant bat-like creature that emerged from an old abandoned mine. The identity of this mysterious monster has never been discovered, but over 100 years later a new book is retelling the amazing tale and hoping to shed some light on what happened all those years ago. The legend dates back to the fall of 1903, when several of Van Meter’s most well . respected citizens reported a half human, half animal with enormous, . smooth bat wings flying about. The . creature is described as moving at speeds the townsfolk had never witnessed before, plus it let off a powerful stench and shot a blinding light . from its horned head. Each . time the townsfolk encountered the creature they fired their guns . at it, but this appeared to have no impact on the creature. On the first night it . was first spotted flying across . the building tops. The next evening it was spotted by both the town doctor and bank cashier . Peter Dunn who took a plaster cast of its 'great three-toed tracks.' On the third night, a man spotted it perched atop a telephone pole. Another resident who saw it, described the monster as hopping like a kangaroo, while the local high . school teacher likened it to a devil. Scared and angered by what they had witnessed, the townsfolk followed the creature to an abandoned coal mine near an old brickyard where they heard a noise from the mine. ‘Presently the noise opened up again, as . though Satan and a regiment of imps were coming forth for battle,’ reads an article in the Des Moines Daily News from Oct. 3, 1903. The unsolved mystery of the strange creature has haunted the Iowa town of Van Meter for more than 100 years . A photo of the '1901 Bachelors of Van Meter,' including several men who claimed to have seen the mysterious monster . The monster appeared together with a smaller version. In a flash of bright light they sailed away, but returned in the morning when the town's men had gathered with weapons ‘to rid the earth of them’. ‘The reception they received would have sunk the Spanish fleet, but aside from unearthly noise and peculiar odor they did not seem to mind it, but slowly descended the shaft of the old mine.’ The creature was never seen again. This amazing tale has survived and been retold for several generations now and a written version even exists in the town’s centennial book. The new book is the work of Chad Lewis, who has written over 15 books about the supernatural, plus co-authors Noah Voss and Kevin Lee Nelson and help from local librarian Jolena Walker. Author Chad Lewis visited Van Meter to speak to local residents about the creature and visit several historic locations including the mine .

Lewis says he has found no evidence to suggest the monster was a hoax, . although be believes the facts of the story may have been embellished over the years. Lewis told the Des Moines Register that even though he said he’s unsure . what happened those fall nights in 1903 in Van Meter, seeking the . answer was more important than finding it. 'It was an era when anything was possible. Science was starting to gain momentum. In fact, they had just discovered the mountain gorilla. So the beast in the jungle was real,' he told. 'People were open to the fact that anything could happen.'

62,"It was once the place to buy panthers, tigers and camels and even caught the fancy of Ronald Reagan, who rang up to pay for a baby elephant. But the Harrods Pet Kingdom will soon be no more - to be replaced with a womenswear section. The London department store's pet section opened in 1917, and rivalled London zoo with a vast array of animals which it sold for more than 50 years until most were outlawed by the 1976 Endangered Species Act. Barmy: John Rendall paid £3,000 in today's money for Christian the lion cub, which he kept in his Chelsea flat . The playwright Noël Coward was one of its more famous customers, having an alligator bought for him for Christmas in 1951 by the Canadian actress Beatrice Lillie. And in 1969, Australian backpackers John Rendall and Anthony Bourke bought Christian the lion cub for 250 guineas, or £3,000 in today's money. Who's a clever boy? Mohammed Al Fayed, the store's former owner, visited the pet department . Sadly he outlived their flat in nearby Chelsea, and had to be released into the wild in Kenya. But the most famous purchase from the pet store came in 1967, when future American president Ronald Reagan, then the governor of California, rang up to buy a baby elephant called Gertie. Legend has it the shop worker on the other end of the phone said: 'Would that be African or Indian, sir?' Less than a decade later, the Endangered Species Act would put a halt to most of the department's more exotic sales. However, it maintained a good trade in hamsters, rabbits, cats and pedigree dogs until recently. Mr Rendall told the Evening Standard: 'It was a completely different time and the world has moved on. 'After the Endangered Species Act they couldn’t have a zoo, and the pet shop was no longer a big draw so I understand they have to think of something more profitable but it’s certainly the passing of an era.' A Harrods spokesman said: 'The Pet Kingdom department will close to make way for further exciting planned developments in our womenswear offering. 'Employees have been informed and Harrods is working with them to find alternative positions in the store where possible.' The world-famous store was once owned by the outspoken billionaire Mohammed Al Fayed, but was bought out by the Qatari royal family's fund Qatar Holding in 2010 - becoming only the fifth owner since it was founded.

The region is known for its diverse natural beauty and attracts thousands of visitors every year. The name literally means 'Thick Forest of the South' and it's easy to see why. Banfi added: 'At the first moment it's scary because you don't know the animal and everybody says it's dangerous. 'But after a while you understand that nothing happens if you respect the snake. 'I have never been so close to a snake like this before. But I think a small poisonous snake is more scary than a big one. At least you can see the anacondas clearly and know what they're doing.'

However, the crew and passengers of a Royal Air Force plane which crashed during ferocious conflict in 1950 have finally been laid to rest, four years after their bodies were excavated in 2008. All 12 victims - including eight British servicemen - were given a full burial today following a painstaking search inspired by the brother of one of the dead airmen. Crash site: The wreckage of RAF Dakota KN630 which crashed deep in the Malaysian jungle on August, 1950, during a target marking mission near Kempong Jendera, killing all 12 crew and passengers on board . Remains: The bodies were discovered in 2008, excavated from shallow graves close to the plane's wreckage . Paying their respects: Members of the 150-strong expedition team laying a poppy wreath at the crash site . Military honour: Members of the Queen's Colour Squadron and the 47th Squadron of the British Royal Air Force carry a casket of a British soldier for the reburial ceremony at the Commonwealth War Grave Cemetery . The RAF Dakota aircraft suffered catastrophic engine failure and went down during a mission in 1950. UK forces were dispatched to the country to fight against Communist insurgents in a conflict known as the Malayan Emergency between 1948 and 1960. The plane from 52 Squadron had been dropping smoke markers near Kempong Jendera to help Lincoln bombers pinpoint Communist camps, but it lost power during its second run and plummeted into a ravine. RAF pilot Edward Talbot, 27, from Dorchester, Dorset; navigator Geoffrey Carpenter, 23, from West Norwood, Greater London and signaller Thomas O'Toole, 34, from Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, were the crew. They left their base at RAF Changi, Singapore, on the morning of August 25, 1950, with four Royal Army Service Corps Despatchers - Corporal Phillip Bryant, 25, from Southend-on-Sea, Essex; Driver Peter Taylor, 20, from Bournemouth, Dorset; Driver Roy Wilson, 21, from Birkenhead, Merseyside and Driver Oliver Goldsmith, 21, from Neston, Cheshire.

Tragic: Signaller Thomas O'Toole (left) and Navigator Geoff Carpenter (right) were among those who perished . The RAF Dakota aircraft - like this one - suffered catastrophic engine failure and went down during a mission in 1950 . Described as a guerilla war, the . Malayan Emergency was a conflict fought between the UK, Commonwealth and . other security forces against Communist insurgents in . Malaysia. It lasted from 1948 to 1960 and began after a period of sustained civil unrest in the region. The Malayan economy was left in turmoil following the withdrawal of Japan at the end of the Second World War. Attempts were made by the British . administration to repair the country's economy, as revenue from Malaya's . tin and rubber industries were important to Britain's own post-war . recovery. However, food was scarce and . expensive, wages were low and unemployment was high. Significant labour . unrest resulted in a large number of strikes between 1946 and 1948. Protestors were dealt with harshly . during the strikes, with many being arrested and deported. This resulted . in protesters becoming more and more militant. The Malayan Emergency was sparked on . June 16, 1948, by the first overt act of war; three European plantation . managers were killed at Sungai Siput, Perak, and retaliation against Communist insurgents was swift. Passengers Major John Procter, a . British Army Officer; Anker Rentse, a civilian lands development . officer; Pc Mohammed Bin Abdul Lalil; Sakiak guide Saiap Alais Sherda . and civilian Yaacob Mat were picked up later at Kota Bahu airfield. A rescue party reached the crash site in early September 1950 after nine days journey on foot to discover all 12 had died. The bodies were buried near the crash . site in a shallow grave because the difficult terrain and prevailing . security situation placed the rescue party at severe risk of attack. However, decades later, the brother of Flight Navigator Geoffrey Carpenter - 82-year-old Dennis - wrote to the Malaysian tourist office in . Britain asking for a map of the remote mountainous region around . Kampung Penchong where they died. In . a remarkable stroke of luck, his request landed on the desk of a . military officer at the Malaysian High Commission in London. Colonel . Tajri Alwi ordered a full-scale expedition to be carried out to recover . the remains of the warplane, and incredibly, the Malaysian Army’s 8th . Brigade located the wreckage. In November 2008 a 150-strong team of Malaysian military, police and specialist forensic archaeologists recovered the men's remains. Father of three Mr Carpenter, who is married to . Jean, 82, said: ‘He left home so young I never knew him fully but we were always . determined to see him properly buried. ‘We could have gone out before now but we had . nowhere to visit. It is comforting that we now have a proper grave with a . headstone.’ Excavation: Members of the 150 strong expedition team search for remains at the crash site. The dead were found in 2008 .

67,"Scientists believe they may have found evidence to show that big cats really are roaming the British countryside, by analysing teeth marks on the bones of their 'victims'. From the Beast of Trowbridge, to the Wildcat of Woodchester, big cat sightings have sparked the imaginations of many people over the years, although bar a few fuzzy photographs there has been little to prove their existence. Now expert Dr Andrew Hemmings believes he has found proof that big cats have been stalking Gloucestershire and neighbouring counties by analysing the remains of wild animals, which appear to have been eaten by beasts larger than any knows British carnivores. Beastly goings on: Scientists believe they may have found evidence to show that big cats, such as the 'Beast of Trowbridge', spotted earlier this year, really are roaming the British countryside, by analysing teeth marks on the bones of their 'victims' Dr Hemmings, a senior lecturer in animal science at the Royal Agricultural University in Cirencester, has spent the last year examining 20 animal skeletons which all bore unusual teethmarks. Some of the livestock and deer remains, found by farmers, landowners and volunteers, had been found in unusual circumstances which suggested that they may have been killed by a big cat. Dr Hemmings studied the bones in order to figure out which animals had eaten them, and in a quarter of his samples found that the 'tooth pit' markings made by canine teeth had been inflicted by an animal larger than those living in the British countryside, such as badgers and foxes. Dogs' teeth can leave behind similar markings, so Dr Hemmings also examined the bones to look for markings made by the carnassial teeth - used for cutting flesh. These teeth are wider apart in a big cat than a dog, which would enable Dr Hemmings to eliminate dogs as being behind the attacks, according to the Daily Telegraph. He was unable to reach a firm conclusion in 17 of the cases, but said that in the remaining three there were clear indications to show that big cats were responsible. One of the bones came from a wild boar found in Gloucestershire, while the others were from sika deer discovered in Dorset. Some believe that the animals are the descendents of large species such as panthers, leopards and lynx which were released into the wild in the 1970s after their owners were banned from keeping them as pets by the Dangerous Wild Animals act . The scientist is now hoping to uncover more evidence, including fresh carcasses which may show traces of feline DNA, before his research is publish in the Journal of Archaeological Science. 'All three are certainly wider than you would expect to find in a dog imprint', he told the Daily Telegraph. 'But we need to let the sample size build up before we have anything approaching a statistical basis.' Dr Hemmings said that his research was . not the most conclusive proof of big cats, but added to the growing . weight of evidence to suggest that big cats were living in Britain. 'We are excited as we are finding some tooth pits in many of the . bones that suggest the animals could have been killed by a large-sized . feline, but at the moment it is impossible to tell whether they have . been caused by a domestic dog or big cat,' he told local newspaper the Gloucester Citizen last month. Big cat sightings have been a regualr . feature of country life, going back decades, such as in the case of the . Beast of Bodmin, said to live in Cornwall. More than 60 sightings of a large black cat have occurred in the area over the years and in 2005, a skull with large fangs and thought to be the remains of a big cat were found in the River Fowey close to the moor. In 2005 a large cat scull was found in the river Fowey, on the edge of Bodmin Moor, however, it was later found to have come from a leopard-skin rug . The skull was sent to the Natural History Museum in London for verification. They determined that it was a genuine skull from a young male leopard, but also found that the cat had not died in Britain. In fact, the skull had been imported as part of a leopard-skin rug. Some believe that the animals are the descendents of large species such as panthers, leopards and lynx which were released into the wild in the 1970s after their owners were banned from keeping them as pets by the Dangerous Wild Animals act. In August, pensioners Herbert and Doreen Smith told how they had spotted a big cat, dubbed the 'Beast of Trowbridge', prowling through Murhill Woods, near Trowbridge, Wiltshire, eating its prey. There was a flurry of reported sightings of the creature in 2009, with members of the public claiming they had seen a big cat lurking by the side of the road. In January last year DNA tests were carried out on the carcasses . of three roe deer found dead at Woodchester National Park, near Stroud, . in a bid to establish how they were killed. One of the deer had its vital organs missing and had had its snout severed - the hallmarks of a panther-like kill - but the tests found no evidence of a wild cat, which many had called the Wildcat of Woodchester, being involved. In February 2012, grainy film footage emerged online showing what . appears to be a 6ft-long beast slinking across a field just three miles . from Woodchester Park. Teaching assistant Coryn Memory, who lives . in the area, said she had spotted the large black animal - dubbed the . 'Wildcat of Woodchester', five times before shooting the video. She . said her first sighting came in July 2009, when she saw the . panther-like creature crossing a field near her house in Thrupp, near . Stroud. Also in February 2012, a gigantic paw print was discovered in the Mendip hills near Bristol, this size of which correlated with the paw of a big cat, according to wildlife experts, and were unlikely to be those of a fox - unless it was an extremely large one. The Mendips have been the site of several reported big cat sightings in recent years, and savaged carcasses discovered in the West Country added weight to claims that at least one giant beast is living there. In July last year, Sir Benjamin Slade claimed a beast had been on his land and that animals had been killed at the 98-acre Maunsel House. A major hunt for a creature nicknamed 'The Essex Lion' was underway in August 2012, when photographs of what appeared to be a lion spotted near a caravan park at Clacton were handed to police. Police and zoo workers armed with tranquilliser guns were scrambled to hunt for the Essex Lion, only for the creature to be exposed as a domestic cat . Following reports of a wild animal on the loose, armed officers and two police helicopters using heat-seeking equipment, which cost £880 an hour to run, were scrambled. Workers from nearby Colchester Zoo carrying tranquilliser guns scoured the fields and residents were warned to stay indoors. Caravanners were temporarily moved to a nearby garden centre. However, the creature was later revealed to be a domestic cat, named Teddy. The . Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food  conducted an official . investigation into the 'beast' and other unknown animals reported to be . roaming Britain in 1995. It concluded there was no 'verifiable evidence' of exotic felines loose in Britain. However, it also stated that the investigation could not prove that big cats were 'not present'.","Scientists believe they may have found evidence to show big cats roam Britain.
Dr Andrew Hemmings has spent the last year examining 20 animal skeletons.
Some of the livestock and deer remains had been found in unusual circumstances.
He studied the bones to figure out which animals had eaten them.
In a quarter of his samples found that the 'tooth pit' markings made by canine teeth had been inflicted by an animal larger than those living in the British countryside, such as badgers and foxes.<|eot_id|>"
68,"Borussia Dortmund eased past Galatasaray to continue their 100% record in this season's Champions League group stages. A brace from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, followed by goals from Marco Reus and Adrian Ramos, secured the points and took Dortmund three clear of Arsenal in Group D. The Gunners came from behind in Brussels to steal a late, vital 2-1 win against Anderlecht, with goals from Kieran Gibbs and Lukas Podolski. Their victory means they stay relatively close to Dortmund, but it is the Germans who look the most fearful in this group. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang wheels away in celebration after scoring his side's first goal in Istanbul on Wednesday .

Goals: Aubameyang 6, 18, Reus 41, Ramos 83 . Referee: Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz . In Turkey, Dortmund did not have to wait long to take the lead, when Aubameyang tucked away a Marco Reus cross with ease to put the away side ahead after just six minutes. The German's have struggled in their Bundesliga campaign, winning just two of their first eight matches, but they are having no such trouble on the European stage. To compound Galatasaray's misery early on, Aubameyang doubled both his tally and his side's lead with Dortmund's second after 16 minutes. Latching onto Lukasz Piszczek's inch-perfect cross, the Gabon international finished with relative ease to take the game further from the home side's reach. Marco Reus continued the rout four minutes before the break, when he hammered home a wonderful strike from 25 yards out. The goalkeeping was questionable from Galatasaray stopper Fernando Muslera, but to take anything away from Reus' effort would be an injustice. In the second-half, Dortmund continued their impressive performance, albeit at a slower pace than the first. Shinji Kagawa was injured with 10 minutes to play, and was replaced by Adrian Ramos. The Columbian scored twice in Dortmund's 3-0 win over Anderlecht, and took less than a minute to get on the scoresheet again.

70,"A university lecturer is claiming to have photographed fairies flying through the air in the British countryside. John Hyatt, 53, says his series of photos which were taken over the past two years prove the tiny winged creatures do exist in the Rossendale Valley, Lancashire. Mr Hyatt, Director of Manchester Institute for Research and Innovation in Art and Design (MIRIAD) at Manchester Metropolitan University insists his photos are genuine and have not been altered in any way. A university lecturer is claiming to have photographed these 'fairies' flying through the air in the British countryside . John Hyatt, 53, says his series of photos which were taken over the past two years prove that they do exist in the Rossendale Valley, Lancashire . And he has now put his photographs on display at a special exhibition. Mr Hyatt, who was a member of the Three Johns punk band in the 1980s and 1990s, says adults that have seen his photos have started to harbour ideas that they may indeed be real. He said: 'It was a bit of a shock when I blew them up, I did a double take. Mr Hyatt insists his photos are genuine and have not been altered in any way . 'From my experience they were just enjoying themselves and there was a little dance in the sunlight going on' said Mr Hyatt . 'I went out afterwards and took pictures of flies and gnats and they just don’t look the same. 'People can decide for themselves what they are. 'The message to people is to approach them with an open mind. 'I think it’s one of those situations where you need to believe to see. 'A lot of people who have seen them say they have brought a little bit of magic into their lives and there’s not enough of that around.' Mr Hyatt, who lives Rawtenstall, has posted some of his images on social media and says they have attracted much debate. The existence of fairies has long been resigned to the realm of children’s books and Disney films, such as Tinkerbell in Peter Pan, right, but Mr Hyatt, left, wants to get more adults to bring 'magic into their lives' The exhibition, called Rossendale Fairies, will be on show at The Whitaker Museum in Whitaker Park in Rossendale, throughout the spring. Mr Hyatt said the name is a nod to the famous story of the Cottingley fairies where two schoolgirls in Bradford claimed to have photographed fairies in their garden, which they confirmed 60 years later had been faked with cardboard cut-outs. However he admits the creatures he snapped are a long way from the characters depicted in children’s stories and hopes his pictures will change people’s perceptions of them. 'Everything gets stereotyped, whatever it is. 'But there are stranger things in life than fairies, and life grows everywhere. Experts and the simply sceptical will no doubt point to explanations involving reflections, flashes or technical glitches or that the tiny shapes could be a flea, left or a fly, right . In 2009, Phyllis Bacon, 55, believed she took a photo of a fairy at the bottom of her garden in New Addington, near Croydon in South London . 'I don’t believe they are just smaller versions of us and go home and have a cup of tea at the end of the day. 'And one is suggesting they have any special powers. 'From my experience they were just enjoying themselves and there was a little dance in the sunlight going on. 'They are just beautiful pictures and beauty can make people believe.' In 2009, Phyllis Bacon, 55, believed she took a photo of a fairy at the bottom of her garden in New Addington, near Croydon in South London. Cottingley, a village outside Bradford in Yorkshire, would have remained in much deserved obscurity had 16-year-old Elsie Wright not taken a remarkable photograph of her ten-year-old cousin, Frances Griffiths, playing with 'fairies' on the banks of a stream which ran behind the garden of Elsie's house. A few days earlier, in the summer of 1917, Frances had slipped and gone into the stream, later telling her mother she had fallen into the water while she was 'playing with the fairies'. Her mother, unamused, sent her up to the attic bedroom she shared with Elsie where, later that afternoon, the two girls hatched a childish prank that would make headlines around the world, severely damage the reputations of eminent public figures and generate a controversy that endured for generations. Elsie suggested they should take a photograph of the 'fairies' to prove to Frances' mother that she had been telling the truth. The girls drew some fairies, cut them out and pasted them on to cardboard. With a few long hatpins on which to mount their 'fairies' and a roll of zinc oxide bandage tape. Arthur Wright willingly agreed to lend his daughter his camera and girls set off, blissfully unaware that they were about to create one of the most reproduced photographs in history. They arranged the four fairies - three with wings and one playing a piped instrument - in front of Frances, who put flowers in her hair, cupped her chin in her hand and, curiously, stared intently at the camera rather than the fairies when Elsie took the picture. Wright developed the exposed plate a darkroom he asked Elsie what they were, and she told him they were the fairies that she and Frances played with by the stream - they took another photo a month later. Polly Wright, Elsie's mother, and her sister, Annie Griffiths, Frances' mother took the  photographs to a meeting of the . Theosophical Society in Harrogate. Knowledge of photography was not . widespread at this time and few understood that the 'spirit' could be . introduced by a simple double exposure on the same photographic plate. As . a result, many Spiritualists were encouraged to believe that the camera . could 'see' what the naked eye could not, a belief which helped . legitimise the Cottingley fairy photographs. Soon the word spread and it was only many decades later did they admit that the photographs were faked and involved cut-out drawings of fairy figures that were fastened to foliage with hatpins. Elsie and Frances stuck doggedly to their story for years. Not until March 1983, when she was 76 years old, did Frances finally confess. 'I'm fed up with all these stories,' she complained. 'I hated those photographs and cringe every time I see them. I thought it was a joke, but everyone else kept it going. It should have died a natural death 60 years ago.' Elsie at first refused to comment, but later confirmed her cousin's story: 'I do not want to die and leave my grandchildren with a loony grandmother to remember.' Frances continued to claim, contrarily, that she had seen fairies and that the fifth photograph - the fairy bower - was authentic. She died in 1986; Elsie died two years later. 'The joke was only meant to last two hours,' said Elsie towards the end of her life. 'It lasted 70 years.'","John Hyatt, 53, says his series of photos which were taken over the past two years prove the tiny winged creatures do exist in the Rossendale Valley, Lancashire.

72,"A former Colorado jail officer has been arrested and charged with murdering his wife, three years after local detectives allegedly covered up evidence of his crime and ruled her death a suicide - even though she was shot in the back of the head. Ashley Fallis' family never believed the 28-year-old mother of three had killed herself and they campaigned for three years for police in Evans, Colorado, to reopen the case and investigate whether her husband, Tom Fallis, was responsible for the New Years Day 2012 shooting. Tom Fallis, 34, was arrested today in Bloomington, Indiana, where he had been living with the couple's three young children after fleeing Colorado. He will be extradited back to Colorado to stand trial. Scroll down for video . Murdered: Ashley Fallis, 28, was shot in the back of the head after a New Year's party in 2012.

He will be extradited back to Colorado to stand trial . Didn't give up: Ashley's parents Joel Raguindin (left) and Jenna Fox (right) campaigned to have their daughter's case re-opened after claiming the police covered up evidence of a crime . Ashley's parents, Jenna Fox and Joel Raguindin, are flying to Indiana to take custody of their grandchildren and raise them as their own. A grand jury indicted Tom Fallis for murder after police agreed to reopen the investigation following a series of damning reports by KDVR-TV reporter Justin Joseph. Ashley was found shot in the back of the head after a booze-fueled New Year's Eve party at the Fallis home turned sour when Tom Fallis learned someone had brought marijuana to the party and became enraged. Fallis, who was working as a Weld County corrections officer, called 911 in screaming hysterics to say his wife had committed suicide. He angrily denied that he had anything to do with his wife's death and Evans police quickly ruled that Ashley had died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Mr Joseph uncovered shocking evidence that was either ignored or left out of a police report by Evans police officer Michael Yates. Yates was later cleared of criminal charges by an independent investigation, but still faces an internal review, according to the Denver Fox affiliate. Tom Fallis became irate in a police interview when an interrogator suggested his wife could not have shot herself in the back of the head . Ashley Fallis could be heard screaming for her husband to get off of her before the gunshot that took her life . The bedroom where Ashley was found was a mess and showed signs of a struggle - despite Tom Fallis' claims that he and his wife had never had a fight . Among the details that KDVR uncovered: A friend at the party who said he overheard Ashley crying for her husband to get off of her; a neighbor who said he heard outside his window as Tom Fallis confess to killing his wife; scratches and defensive wounds on Tom Fallis' chest that indicated there had been a struggle; reports from Ashley's parents that he had been violently angry before Ashley's death; clear evidence of a struggle in the bedroom where Ashley's body was found - including . Most shockingly, one of the the Fallis' young children, age six, told police that she saw 'daddy getting the gun ready' and 'saw daddy shoot mommy.' 'He was irate and explosive. He was abusive with his words and he was telling us he hated us, and to ‘F everybody’ and then he went into the room and slammed the door,' Ashley's mother, Ms Fox, told KDVR. Ms Fox and Mr Raguindin never gave up their search for justice. They rallied friends and supporters to picket outside the police station when Ashley's death was ruled a suicide. They have targeted Officer Yates and called for him to be criminally indicted. They raised money for lawyers fees to win visitation rights for their grandchildren and set up a memorial for their Ashley. A Facebook page that they set up for Ashley, which has nearly 500 followers, states unequivocally: 'Ashley Fallis was murdered by Tom Fallis the night of, 1/1/12.

75,"The woman killed in a horror crash involving reality TV star Bruce Jenner once appeared in a music video alongside Elvis Presley, it has been revealed. Kim Howe, 69, died after her car was hit head-on by a Hummer earlier this month, with investigators looking into whether Jenner rear-ended her vehicle, causing it to cross into the oncoming lane. Now it has been revealed that widow Ms Howe made a short appearance in 1967 movie Double Trouble, starring Elvis Presley, when she danced with The King himself. Scroll down for video . Happier times: Kim Howe, the 69-year-old who died in a multi-car pileup earlier this month involving Bruce Jenner, once appeared in a film alongside Elvis Presley (pictured left) Ms Howe was killed while driving along Pacific Coast Highway on February 7. During a pile-up her white Lexus (pictured) was forced into oncoming traffic and hit by a Hummer, killing her . In her early 20s, Ms Howe is seen dressed as a traditional German frauline holding a stein of beer with her long blonde hair tied up in a bun. She features on screen a few moments into the song I Love Only One Girl, as Elvis walks down the steps of a bandstand and into a dancing crowd before walking up to her. The King takes her hand, they raise their glasses and then perform a short dance, during which time Ms Howe can be seen beaming at the music star. Elivs grabs a bouquet of flowers from a passing seller, hands them to Ms Howe, and then walks off while continuing the song. According to gossip site TMZ this was one of the highlights of Ms Howe's life, as she does not appear to have starred in any other film or TV projects. Ms Howe lived alone in a $2.5million house in Calabsas, Los Angeles, following the death of her husband Robert in 2003. The pair had no children, but Ms Howe was reported to own a dog. More details of Ms Howe's past emerged as police revealed they have not yet determined who started the car accident which lead to her death. Law enforcement officials have revealed they have not yet determined who started that chain-reaction crash involving Bruce Jenner that resulted in a woman's death on a Malibu highway earlier this month . Jenner's SUV rear-ended two cars, pushing a white Lexus into oncoming traffic, the official said. The driver, Kim Howe, 69, was killed when it was struck head-on by a Hummer . It was initially thought that Ms Howe may have hit a Prius which was stopped at lights in front of her, causing Jenner to hit her from behind, forcing her into oncoming traffic where she was hit again. New reports have suggested that Jenner could have caused the accident by rear-ending both Ms Howe's white Lexus, and the black Prius in front of her. Jenner was hauling an off-road vehicle on a trailer behind his Cadillac Escalade on February 7 when he steered to avoid cars slowing for a traffic light in front of him on Pacific Coast Highway. The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department is investigating the cause of the wreck and will consider whether to issue a citation that could result in criminal charges - possibly vehicular manslaughter. The official said the video taken by cameras on an MTA bus in the area showed Jenner's vehicle continued forward and rear-ended a Toyota Prius. Officials initially said the victim's white Lexus had struck the Prius. Most significantly  the video shows that the Lexus driver didn’t make contact with the Prius involved, reports TMZ. A video showing a possible recreation of the accident has been created by Integral Media Works. Investigators have sought cellphone records to see if any drivers were distracted, but the video appears to show that Jenner was not using his phone. His publicist, Alan Nierob, has said Jenner was not texting and is cooperating with investigators. A video showing a possible recreation of the accident has been created by Integral Media Works . The video shows Jenner rear-end the Lexus and when the Lexus clears his lane, his SUV keeps moving and crashes into the Prius . The MTA video is alleged to show that Jenner hits the Lexus, propelling it into a Hummer coming the other way. Jenner then continues on and hits the Prius . According to earlier reports, the Lexus had been in Jenner's path after coming to a halt when it hit a Prius travelling ahead. The Lexus was then pushed into the path of a Hummer coming the other way, leaving the vehicle a crumpled wreck and the sole occupant, 69-year-old Kim Howe, dead. The Kardashian family patriarch, who escaped the crash unscathed, took a roadside sobriety test in front of officers in the wake of the collision, which he passed. This latest evidence suggests that rather than the chain reaction being caused by the victim's Lexus hitting the Prius in front of her, Jenner may have hit both cars, claims TMZ. Law enforcement sources told the celebrity news site that one operating theory is that the Prius had been stopped behind cars and, as a traffic light turned green, vehicles began moving. It was at this point, sources say, that Jenner rear-ended the Lexus and when the Lexus cleared his lane, his car kept moving and crashed into the Prius. TMZ reported that police say when Jenner hit the Lexus, it veered left while his Escalade moved to the right. Detectives in Malibu have opened a vehicular homicide investigation. If any of the drivers in the crash are found criminally negligent, felony charges could be filed - which carry a sentence of up to six years in prison. Jenner's Cadillac Escalade hit the back of the victim's white Lexus on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California, which caused a chain reaction that resulted in the luxury sedan veering into oncoming traffic . An aerial view of the crash scene on February 7 shows the damaged cars, and police markings as they work to investigate the cause . If it is determined that Jenner's Escalade struck both cars and authorities find he was following too closely, it would make prosecution for vehicular manslaughter more likely than if he was just part of the chain reaction, TMZ claims. Investigations will determine if Jenner, or any of the other three drivers involved in the collision, were texting or on their mobile phones at the time of the collision. It is illegal to text while driving in California. The star's representative has denied that he was texting behind the wheel. Breaking his silence on the crash the following day, Jenner said in a statement: 'My heartfelt and deepest sympathies go out to the family and loved ones, and to all of those who were involved or injured in this terrible accident.' 'It is a devastating tragedy, and I cannot pretend to imagine what this family is going through at this time. I am praying for them. I will continue to cooperate in every way possible.' But three days after the crash, Jenner was seen talking on his phone while driving in Los Angeles. The reality star had the device pressed to his ear while behind the wheel in Thousand Oaks, California.

76,"Social media should be monitored by police and security services, a former intelligence chief has said, to prevent paedophiles and terrorists from communicating unhindered. Sir David Omand, former Permanent Secretary and Security and Intelligence Co-ordinator in the Cabinet Office, says criminals are increasingly making use of online social networks such as Twitter and Facebook to communicate. He added that those responsible for protecting society need to use the technology to keep suspects under surveillance. Challenge: Sir David Omand says that without the monitoring and . collection of social media intelligence the sites could become 'secret . spaces' where those carrying out illegal activities could communicate . unhindered . He said that without the monitoring and . collection of social media intelligence, known as Socmint, websites . could become ‘secret spaces’ where those carrying out illegal activities . could communicate freely. However, the former Whitehall Intelligence officer made it clear that an individual’s account should only be ‘hacked’ into under certain circumstances. The soon to be published Communications Capabilities Development Programme is expected to force internet service providers to store details of when and where emails are sent and by whom. Mr Omand wants a Green Paper to be published on monitoring social media sites and for private industry to link up with the Government to develop analytical tools to monitor developments. There have been reports to suggest that Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden are using social media to communicate with one another and Mr Omand said that in such circumstances the authorities need to be able to gain access to private accounts. Monitoring: Mr Omand said criminals are increasingly making use . of online social networks such as Twitter and Facebook to communicate . He added: ‘I don’t know anybody who thinks that it should be ring-fenced and allowed to become a secret space.’ A new report by the think-tank Demos indicates that Twitter and Facebook accounts could be legally accessed by using the Regulatory and Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA). The act states that warrants are not necessary for ‘directed surveillance’ of a suspect – for example when monitoring a person’s movements – and that the principle could be extended to the internet where investigators were using publicly available information. However, the former director of GCHQ said it was essential that monitoring was put on a legal footing so that where individuals have put up privacy settings on their social network accounts any monitoring which involves the interception of communications should require a warrant. Networking: Mr Omand wants a Green Paper to be published on monitoring social media sites and for private industry to link up with the public sector to develop analytical surveillance tools . The report states: ‘Democratic legitimacy demands that where new methods of intelligence gathering and use are to be introduced, they should be on a firm legal basis and rest on parliamentary and public understanding of what is involved, even if the operational details of the sources and methods used must sometimes remain secret. ‘People now share vastly more . personal information about themselves, their friends and their networks . in new a varied ways: what is ‘public’ and what is ‘private’ is not . always obvious and differs greatly across social media platforms and . even within social media platforms.’ The . report’s publication comes against the background of intense . controversy over the Government’s plans to extend the monitoring of all . texts, telephone calls, emails and internet traffic in the UK. Sir David said that proper regulation was essential to ensure public trust in the system. ‘The . problem with social media is that it doesn’t really fit the 19th and . 20th century structures we have for how you go about regulating these . matters,’ he said. ‘After Iraq, we must be sure that if people are engaged in this kind of monitoring, they are doing it for the reasons set out in the authorisation (and that) it has not been politicised.’ A Home Office spokesman said communications data has played a role in every major security service counter-terrorism operation over the past decade and in 95 per cent of all serious organised crime investigations. However, Google says that when it comes to accessing pornography online laws will not protect children - only parents can keep their children safe from such adult material.","Sir David Omand says that without monitoring social media sites, websites could become'secret spaces' where those carrying out illegal activities could communicate freely.

The photograph, which has been shared online, appears to show a crustacean that is at least 50ft-wide lurking in shallow water. While some insist it is proof of 'Crabzilla', others argue that the shadowy figure is nothing more than an unusually-shaped sandbank - or is simply a playful hoax. Crabzilla: The photograph, above, which has been shared online, appears to show a crustacean that is at least 50ft wide lurking in the shallow water. It dwarfs the fishing boasts resting on the nearby pier . The image shows the outline of a crab in the mouth of the Kent harbour - dwarfing the fishing boats resting on the nearby pier. It is shaped like an edible crab, a species that is commonly found in British water and grows to an average of five inches. The photograph was posted on a website called Weird Whitstable - an online collection of strange and unusual sightings in the town. Its curator, Quinton Winter, said that at first he thought the image - sent to him by a follower - showed an unusual sand formation, but that he is now convinced it is a monster of the deep. Speaking to the Daily Express, he claimed that he saw the giant creature close to the shore when he took his son crabbing last summer. He said: 'At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ""that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood"".

78,"Margaret Rowe, 65, claims she lost her £184,000 a year job and objected to a boss circulating a nude portrait of his wife in a 'chauvinistic culture' A city lawyer who was sacked after she voiced objections to a boss circulating a nude portrait of his wife around the office was described by her manager as having 'the maturity of an eight year old.' Margaret Rowe, 65, of North London, claims she lost her £184,000 a year job at 'chauvinistic' Fidelity Worldwide Investment because she refused to act like a woman who 'knows her place'. But Philip Warland, head of public policy and Miss Rowe's manager, said she constantly made aggressive and false accusations that she was being treated differently because she was a woman. He said her comments were made with 'startling vehemence and ferocity' and had a 'machine gun delivery.' He recalled he was physically sick after one 'abusive' encounter. Miss Rowe had objected when Fidelity's head of portfolio management James Bateman showed junior women colleagues photographs of the full-frontal painting of his wife, Cambridge don Dr Victoria Bateman. She said many women in the office found the picture awkward. She also claimed she was constantly seen as aggressive because she was assertive and forthright in a man's culture. The Central London tribunal previously heard she had claimed victimisation when she was overlooked for promotion at the firm. But she was sacked after an independent investigation found no evidence of sex discrimination or bullying. Ms Rowe is claiming unfair dismissal and sex discrimination against Fidelity. She said after she was dismissed it was the end of her career because at 65 she had been planning to work until she was 70. She joined the firm in 2007 and took a post as Director of Public Policy under Mr Warland in 2013. He told the tribunal that claims he treated her differently because she was a woman were 'without foundation.' 'I have been a manager in the City for 50 years and one of my leitmotifs has been to value people for themselves,' he said. 'Partly this is based on Christian principle.' Mr Warland, who was a trustee of the charity Oasis which rescues women from prostitution and trafficking, said he had become frustrated with Miss Rowe's constant attempts to undermine him. Philip Warland claims Miss Rowe was aggressive in her dealings with him and spoke with ferocity . He admitted describing her as having 'the maturity of an eight-year-old' in an email to  his boss, Peter Yandle after another frustrated interaction. He said he tried hard to include Miss Rowe in discussions and meetings, only excluding her from those she was not qualified to attend, but her unwillingness to compromise made her hard to work with. 'It felt like she was jumping from the fact she was not happy with the way she was being treated to allege the treatment was based on her being a woman,' he added. 'That was completely groundless.' In March 2014 Miss Rowe challenged him after the job of Director of Public Policy was given to a man. She had told his boss, Mr Yandle, that the decision 'makes clear I am a lackey', so Mr Warland claims he tried to speak to her and explain her sex was not a factor in the decision. Mr Warland said: 'What was frightening was not the content of what she said but the startling vehemence and ferocity and the machine gun delivery of the personalised invective. 'I found it offensive and abusive and was physically sick when I left the office. 'In my 47 years working in the City I have never encountered this sort of abusive behaviour.' By May Mr Warland said it became increasingly difficult for him to work with Ms Rowe. He added: 'By the time it came to the investigation, I would have found it difficult to get over the aggressiveness with which she treated me on March 31 and I would not want to work in an environment where there was a risk I might be subjected to that again.' The asset management firm says there was nothing prurient about the portrait of the Gonville and Caius College economist, Dr Victoria Bateman (left) by Anthony Connolly which was featured in an exhibition . He said he believed that by December 2013 Miss Rowe had decided she would undermine his authority in any way possible. He added: 'I treated Margaret fairly thoroughout investing a considerable amount of time trying to manage her and work though our issues and her gender never had any part to play in any of my dealings with her and others.' Miss Rowe previously told the tribunal the culture of the asset management firm was chauvinistic. James Bateman is said to have shown junior women colleagues photographs of thepainting of his wife . Other members of staff had told the court they felt her emails were aggressive and she would often overstep the mark from professional interaction to personal attack. The tribunal previously heard that the firm denied there was anything prurient about the portrait of the Gonville and Caius College economist, which was featured in an exhibition. Fidelity insisted the almost life-size painting – which received publicity when it was shown at London's Mall Galleries last year – was meant as a 'challenge against the objectification of women'. Miss Rowe joined Fidelity in 2007 as head of the investments legal team and within four years was earning £135,000 a year and picking up annual bonuses of £49,000. Speaking of her dismissal she previously said: 'It hurt me very deeply I was dismissed when I had gone out of my way to treat people with respect and dignity.' Some bosses accused her of playing the 'woman card' when she did not like a decision that had been made. The tribunal continues.","Margaret Rowe, 65, claims she lost her £184,000 a year job at 'chauvinistic' Fidelity.

Now Bary - whose music has featured on BBC Radio 1 - has posted on Twitter that he and another Briton were abducted and robbed, with their money, phones and guns stolen by other jihadists. 'Hip-hop jihadist': Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 23, walked out of his family's £1million home in Maida Vale, west London, last year to join militant groups, telling them he was 'leaving everything for the sake of Allah' Bary walked out of the family home last year in order to join rebels fighting in Syria. Since then he has been tweeting under the names 'Terrorist' and 'Abu Klasnikov' though his account in now suspended . Bary, who posts under the name 'Terrorist', said: 'Me & Abu Hussein al britani got kidnapped /tortured by FSA/IF scum they stole our 4 ak's and a 7mm, my vechile & our phones and cash.' The tweet was posted last month. A Foreign Office spokesman said he had no details on the claims. Friends said Bary - an aspiring rapper on the 'grime' music scene - grew increasingly radical and violent after mixing with thugs linked to hate preacher Anjem Choudary. He has posted a series of photographs online, including shots of him masked and posing with g guns under the title 'soldier of Allah'. In other messages he called on Allah to 'grant us martyrdom', and praised Osama Bin Laden. Bary, whose music has featured on Radio 1, is one of six children of Adel Abdul Bary, 53. Bary launched a twitter rant against anti-terror police who raided his family home in west London calling them 'kuffar' (non-believers) and pagans . Bary Snr was extradited from Britain to the US in 2011 after an eight-year legal battle that made him a cause celebre of the Left as lawyers took his publicly funded case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

He faces life in prison if convicted of involvement in the bombings of US embassies in East Africa in 1998. His son's appearance among the ranks of UK jihadists in Syria, where several Britons fighting for the militants have already been killed, will add to concerns about their potential threat to the West. Video courtesy of SBTV . 'Tortured': It has been claimed that Bary - whose music has featured on BBC Radio One - and another Briton were abducted and robbed, with their money, phones and guns stolen by other jihadists . Bary lived with his mother Ragaa for more than a decade in a home in Maida Vale, owned by Westminster Council. If it were sold on the open market it would be worth £1million. She travelled to Britain from Egypt in 1990 after her husband was granted refugee status. Friends said Bary's conversion to radical Islam happened as he grew increasingly frustrated with the British authorities over the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And it came despite his fledgling success on the underground grime music scene, where he rapped under the names Lyricist Jinn and L Jinny Bary appeared in dozens of videos, including one in which he posed outside the Bank of England and declared his allegiance to the global hacking group Anonymous.

It is understood that soon afterwards he travelled to Syria, where one of his oldest friends had already joined the fighting. He changed his Twitter name to Soldier of Allah and posed for pictures wearing a mask and military fatigues while carrying an AK-47 and other large assault rifles. Last November he said, 'Oh Allah, grant us martyrdom' and praised Bin Laden, calling him a 'lion'.

80,"What are the chances of this happening? You set up a time-lapse camera in the hope of getting some minute-by-minute shots of the ever-changing beauty of autumnal Windermere. Instead, you capture the clearest snap ever taken of a giant, Loch Ness Monster-style beastie, so close you can almost see it smiling. Scroll down for video . This picture, apparently captured by an amateur photographer, appears to show a creature not unlike the Loch Ness Monster . The photo is said to have been taken by a man who left his camera at the side of the lake to automatically capture images throughout the day, but questions were raised over the suspicious timing of the snap . So the question must be asked: could this be a glimpse of a legendary monster that has been teasing, attracting and eluding sightseers for decades? Or is someone trying to lift Britain’s gloom by suggesting Nessie has fled South in advance of the Scottish independence vote. Add to that the fact the photograph was taken and tweeted by the firm that makes the clever automatic camera responsible for the shot, and it becomes a matter on which even a partial Scottish jury surely would not be able to agree. Yet there are some intriguing elements to this, the alleged first picture of Bownessie, the Sassenach version of the famed Loch Ness Monster. It was taken on an Autographer camera on a tripod at the Cumbrian lake shore at Brockhole. Ellie Williams, who provides photographs for the company, claims she wanted to get a sequence of nature and wildlife shots taken throughout the day. When the camera content was examined on Wednesday, it appeared she might have got more wildlife than she bargained for. The dinosaur-like creature was apparently captured swimming or paddling into the distance before disappearing. ‘At first I thought it might have been a swan or a goose, as I was looking at the image quite small on my smartphone,’ said Ellie, 24. ‘I’m open to suggestions as to what the creature could be – I’m just glad I put the camera in the right place at the right time.’ Yesterday the company said it had examined the images and insisted they had not been altered. A famous photo allegedly showing the Loch Ness Monster was taken in 1934, but was later said to be a fake . The legend of the creature attracts millions of tourists to Loch Ness, Scotland's second largest body of water . Lake Windermere - the largest natural lake in England - is situated about 40 miles from the Scottish border . With tongue firmly in cheek, marketing executive James Ebdon said: ‘At first, we thought it was a swan or goose, or on closer look, a larger animal like a horse with a saddle pack or something. ‘Whatever it is we will leave it to the experts.’ A spokesman for the firm insisted: ‘It certainly looks real. It’s ridiculous, but we can’t offer any logical explanation.’ He said the camera took shots every few minutes, so all the images were scrutinised to see if they revealed anyone putting something in the water or taking it out afterwards. But there was nothing – not even a sighting of Alex Salmond trying to lead Nessie home.","The photo was taken by an amateur photographer who left his camera at the side of the lake to automatically capture images throughout the day.

81,"Growing threat: Infections like C. difficile are becoming increasingly difficult to treat as bugs become more resistant to antibiotics, leaving millions vulnerable . The rise of drug-resistant superbugs will drag the health service back ‘to the early 19th century’, Britain’s most senior medical adviser has warned. Unless urgent action is taken, the ‘ticking timebomb’ of growing antibiotic resistance could leave millions vulnerable to untreatable bugs within a generation. This could make even routine operations such as hip surgery deadly, said Chief Medical Officer Professor Dame Sally Davies. In an attempt to tackle the problem, GPs will be ordered to prescribe fewer antibiotics. While infections are becoming increasingly difficult to beat, no new class of antibiotic has been discovered since 1987. In contrast, a new infection emerges on an almost yearly basis. Dame Sally said the ‘catastrophic threat’ from infections resistant to frontline antibiotics is so serious that she has asked the Government to put antibiotic resistance on the national risk register – ranking it alongside a large-scale terrorist attack or flu pandemic. ‘That is one way of getting central and cross-government action internationally,’ she said. ‘It should be [on the register] because this is a growing problem. And if we don’t get it right, we will find ourselves in a health system not dissimilar to the early 19th century at some point. ‘If we don’t act now, any one of us could go into hospital in 20 years for minor surgery and die because of an ordinary infection that can’t be treated by antibiotics. And routine operations like hip replacements or organ transplants could be deadly because of the risk of infection.’ Acknowledging that ‘global action’ must be taken, she said: ‘This is an international threat.’ In the past five years, the number of cases of blood poisoning from antimicrobial resistant (AMR) forms of E. coli – which is twice as fatal as the normal bug – has gone up 60 per cent. The drug-resistant gut bug alone, which is picked up in hospital in half of cases, could be responsible for up to 2,500 deaths in 2011 – more than MRSA and C. difficile combined. And a deadly strain of tuberculosis which cannot be dealt with by most treatments has trebled in Britain in little over a decade. Figures from the Health Protection Agency (HPA) show that instances of ‘multidrug resistant’ tuberculosis were 81 in 2011, up from just 28 in 2000, with around half of the patients dying. Warning: Chief Medical Officer Professor Dame Sally Davies has said that even routine operations such as hip surgery could become deadly due to growing antibiotic resistance . Cases of extensively-resistant TB, which resists almost all types of drugs, have also emerged in the UK, with 12 in the past two years – as many as in the previous 15 years. Another worrying trend is the rise in infections resistant to powerful antibiotics called carbapenems, the last line of treatment to tackle the most serious infections. Figures from the HPA show samples testing positive for resistance to the drug have gone up more than 250-fold in the past decade, from three in 2003 to 800 in 2012. Warning that ‘widespread’ AMR would be an ‘apocalyptic scenario’, Dame Sally has called for improved protection of our current stock of antibiotics, better incentives for the pharmaceutical industry to develop new drugs, and improved hygiene in hospitals. But with antibiotics liberally used in agriculture, and available over the counter in many countries, these efforts will be undermined without a united global effort. In 2010, infectious diseases accounted for 7 per cent of all deaths and 4 per cent of all potential years of life lost in England. They also lose the economy a staggering £30billion a year in direct costs to the NHS and indirect costs to industry in terms of lost work hours. Emeritus Professor Richard James, former director of the centre for healthcare associated infections at the University of Nottingham, called for ‘effective antibiotic stewardship to prevent the overuse/misuse of antibiotics’.","Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies has warned of growing threat.

I just wanted to think of something that was not so commercial. So starting with the fact that most of what I do is still life based I thought of objects, then alternative ways to use objects whilst online I found some articles on murders that had been committed with 'strange' weapons. 'As I researched it I found more so decided to shoot a series on these bizarre murder weapons. I then photographed them in the studio.

Trying to get Chase pulled from the case, Mrs Myers told a court on Friday: '[Chase said] just think about it, [that] she knows Eric, that everybody has a moment. 'She told me she would hold it until Sunday so I could take some time.' Chase rebutted: 'She testified to things that never came out of my mouth, which makes me think that either she's confused or she's trying to eliminate attorneys as a pre-emptive strike.' A judge dismissed Mrs Myers' motion. Mrs Myers' attorney Alberto Ayo told Fox 13: 'This courage that our client had to come out and talk about these very private facts should be an example for our society. 'There are many woman who endure this abuse in silence and that should not occur.' The couple have filed for divorce and the case is ongoing.","Shirley Myers said she was slapped and punched in the face with an open and closed fist on Friday January 16.

84,"Freed to kill again: Convicted murderer Andrew Dawson called himself the 'Angel of Mercy' and butchered two neighbours after getting a life sentence for a 1981 killing . Five convicted killers released from jail have murdered again in the past four years, some just weeks after leaving custody, it was revealed today. Andrew Dawson, George Johnson, Ernest Wright, David Cook and . Desmond Lee were only given 'whole life' sentences after committing murder for the second time. The families of their victims said today 'life should mean life'. Even some relatives of the killers believe that their family-member should never have been released the first time round. Convicted murderer Andrew Dawson branded himself the 'Angel of Mercy' after a series of murders. He was given a life . sentence in 1982 after admitting the murder of a 91-year-old Henry Walsh in his . flat at Ormskirk, Lancashire, stabbing him a dozen times with bread knife. Within weeks of his release in 2010, he . stabbed defenceless John Matthews and Paul Hancock to death in separate . attacks, before leaving their bodies in their bathtubs in Derby. The 51-year-old told police he felt an 'urge to kill' before knocking on the . men's doors in the block of flats, where he also lived, and hacked them to death. Dawson then . wrote a rambling note to police confessing to one of the killings which . he signed: 'Yours, the Angel of Mercy'. Murder scene: Dawson savagely attacked John Matthews and Paul Hancock in the block of flats that they shared with him, pictured, and then dumped their bodies in bathtubs . His own brother Malcolm told The Sun: 'My brother was clever and hoodwinked those in charge that he was no threat. But he was evil. Cold blooded: George Johnson battered to death an 89-year-old widow after being released from jail after a sadistic murder in 1986 . 'If . you kill you should be locked up forever, no question. My brother never . apologised for what he did — he was just sorry he got caught'. George Johnson murdered Gerald Homer in 1986 for just £3, forcing him to strip naked before hacking him to death, inflicting 35 wounds using knives and scissors in Wolverhampton. He was freed in 2006 and five years later he battered to death 89-year-old widow Florence Habesch for £25 as she made a cup of tea. His attack was delivered with such force he caved in her skull. His first victim's sister Eileen Dawson, 64, told The Sun today: 'Life should mean life, not just 15 or 20 . years. If someone takes someone else's life, then why should they have . their own?' Her husband Vincent, 63, added: 'It isn't right. If . life meant life then that old lady would be still alive today'. Pensioner David Cook, 65, of Rhymney, South Wales, beat neighbour Leonard Hill, . 64, senseless before throttling him with a TV flex in 2011. Cook carried out the violent killing when next-door neighbour Mr Hill paid him a visit. Afterwards Cook ransacked his neighbour’s bungalow, stealing his wallet before going to a nearby pub for a drink with locals. The murder was chillingly similar to the strangulation of Sunday school teacher Beryl Maynard, which he did in 1987. Cook then used a dressing gown cord and 'strangled her and killed her', his trial heard. Killed again: Pensioner David Cook, 65, left, beat neighbour Leonard Hill, 64, right, senseless before throttling him with a TV flex in 2011 - 25 years after his first murder . Murdered: Victim Beryl Maynard (right), with her husband Roger and their two children, was strangled with a dressing gown cord in 1987 by David Cook . 'Evil and dangerous' Desmond Lee killed his lover Christopher Pratt, before dumping his body in 2009. Lee killed his lover by breaking his voice box and a bone in his neck. The . body was still in his flat when he stole Mr Pratt’s credit and debit . cards, paid off a phone bill, bought booze for a party with neighbours, . ordered more than £200-worth of food from Asda and attempted to buy . £1,181-worth of goods from Argos. Lee . killed him while out on licence, having spent nearly 14 . years in jail for the murder of Bradford woman Shirley Carr in 1989. He suffocated Mrs Carr, who was his landlady, in November 1989 after she taunted him over the breakdown of a relationship. Lee was jailed for life in 1990 but released on licence in 2004. Twice jailed: 'Evil and dangerous' Desmond Lee killed his lover Christopher Pratt, before dumping his body in 2009, 20 years after he throttled and killed his landlady . In 2010 pensioner Ernest Wright was told he would spend . the rest of his life behind bars after carrying out a shotgun execution . 38 years after murdering another man . The 70-year-old had served 26 years in prison for a 1971 killing when he was freed on life licence in 1999. Career criminal: Pensioner killer Ernest gunned a man down 38 years after his first murder . Despite his release he continued to mix in criminal circles and carried out several night-time burglaries, police said. Then, in March three years ago, he gunned down Neville Corby, 42, after bursting into his home in Bradford, West Yorkshire. Wearing . a balaclava he twice reloaded his shotgun as he fired six shots at Mr . Corby and his intended target, Craig Freear, 31, whom he had a . long-standing feud with. He was jailed in 1973 after beating Trevor . Hale to death with an iron bar in Aylesbury, then trying to burn his . body in a shallow grave. All the five killers were ready for freedom by parole boards, but . then murdered again, often in similar ways to their first homicide. David Cameron is known to back 'whole life' terms for murderers, but Eurocrats fight them in Strasbourg because they believe they breach the offenders' human rights and are 'inhumane'. Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said: 'Reoffending has been too high for . too long and we are introducing significant reforms to the way offenders . are rehabilitated and managed in the community. 'From 2015 all . prisoners will for the first time receive a minimum 12 months' supervision on release and GPS satellite tags will also allow us to keep . a much closer eye on them. 'Our changes will see the best of the voluntary, public and private sector working together to cut reoffending.' It came as it was revealed that one in seven murders in Britain is committed by suspects freed on bail while awaiting trial for other crimes. Last year 56 murders – more than one a week and a shocking 37 per cent rise on 2011 – were carried out by people bailed by the courts. If they had been remanded in  custody, the victims’ lives may have been saved.","Andrew Dawson, George Johnson, Ernest Wright, David Cook and Desmond Lee were only given 'whole life' sentences after committing murder for the second time.

85,"A hitman who led a shootout in Peru during which a policeman and a rival gang member were killed and two others were injured has been revealed as a 12-year-old boy. Police say Nabil Blanco Cerda is the youngest hitman who has ever been arrested in the country after he was held along with alleged teenage accomplices in Chincha, in the country's Ica region. He was said to be part of a gang that opened fire in a café, killing a rival gangster and injuring two others, then cutting down a policeman in a hail of bullets as they made their escape. Under arrest: Alleged members of the gang which included a 12-year-old hitman are searched after their arrest by Peru's Criminal Investigation Department in the town of Chincha, in the country's Ica region . Agents of Peru's elite Criminal Investigation Department, the Latin American nation's equivalent of the FBI, finally arrested the gang in an armed raid on Sunday. The youngster, together with two 16-year-olds and a number of adults, had allegedly been recruited by Edwin Lopez Gabriel, a mob leader known as 'Loco Peluza', as part of a mafia-style extortion ring. Police say that Gabriel had set up a trade union in order to cover his criminal activities and had used the gang to intimidate businessmen into paying protection money and to wipe out rivals. Operating under the guise of the Civil Construction union, they are said to have stalked the streets of Chincha dealing drugs and extorting cash in a reign of terror which has been linked to four other killings and more than 30 assaults. 'For months [Gabriel] covered up his crimes by pretending to be union leader,' said one of the officers who caught him. In total, 16 people were arrested by police who said they were shocked to find that the gang's hit squad was led by the 12-year-old, who would act as the enforcer while collecting illegal taxes. The discovery of such a young boy involved in violent crime in the country raises the spectre of Brazilian-style gang warfare, in which the youths of that country's ghettoes are enlisted into gangs, sometimes before reaching adolescence. The film City of God gives a fictionalised account of the kinds of violence that the Brazilian favelas have become notorious for. City Of God: The arrest of such a young boy on suspicion of involvement in violent crime and murder raises the spectre of Brazilian-style ghetto violence in Peru . The beginning of the end for the gang came with the March 2 shootout at a Chincha cafe. Members opened fire, killing former convict Miguel Santillan Reymundo, 32, and injuring Marvin Fajardo and Cecilia Sánchez Velásquez Dianderas. Minutes later they shot police Lieutenant Eric Lévano Castilla, 29, six times as he tried to arrest them. A Criminal Investigation Department spokesman said that, along with alleged ringleader Gabriel and the three minors police arrested Roberto Parra Belleza, José Llerena Enríquez, Elvis Medina Bernaola, Jhonatan Asencio Llancari, Miguel Romero Palla, Víctor Tasayco Talla, Ciro Páucar Martínez, Samir Roberto Falla, Steven Moreno Ramos, Luis Cárdenas Chacón y Néstor Echegaray Guillén on suspicion of involvement in the gang.","Nabil Blanco Cerda, 12, was arrested along with alleged accomplices.

87,"Victim: An autopsy report has revealed 50-year-old Wayne A. Jones (pictured) died last year after being shot 23 times by five police officers in Martinsburg, Virginia . A mentally ill man who stabbed a police officer with a pocket knife was fatally shot 23 times by five cops as he lay on the ground. An autopsy report shows Wayne A. Jones, 50, died as a result of multiple gunshot . wounds to his brain, heart, . lungs, liver, kidney and stomach, following the violent shootout in Martinsburg, Virginia, in March 2013. Although the schizophrenic man's death was ruled a homicide, Berkeley County grand jury in October did not indict the officers who shot him. Now the Stephens City man's brothers are suing the city for $200 million in damages on behalf of Jones' estate, claiming the 'rogue' officers used unreasonable and excessive force. The family’s lawyer, Sherman L. Lambert Sr., filed a copy of the autopsy report in federal court in Martinsburg on Tuesday. He also filed an amended lawsuit that adds the officers as defendants. The filing came less than a week after Magistrate James E. Seibert ordered the release of the medical examiner’s findings and a report by West Virginia State Police, which investigated the shooting. Herald Mail Media reported the five defendants in the wrongful death lawsuit are Erik Herb, Paul Lehman, Eric Neely, Daniel North and William Staub. According to the amended complaint, the officers shot at Jones as he tried to get to his feet after he stabbed a cop in the torso with a pocket knife. It was later revealed the wound was so minor, the officer didn't need medical treatment. Lehman was the first officer to encounter Jones and fired his gun eight times. This was followed by Herb's five, Neely's four, Staub's three and North's two. The officers were armed with Sig Sauer .45-caliber handguns that hold nine rounds in the magazine. Taking action: Jones' family members (pictured sitting) are suing the city of Martinsburg, Virginia for $200 million in damages, with the family's lawyer, Sherman L. Lambert Sr., filing a copy of the autopsy report on Tuesday . After the shooting occurred, Martinsburg . police admitted they used projectile stun guns twice on Jones, which . had little effect, and shot him. The lawsuit also claimed Jones' body was left in a pool of blood for four hours before he was moved. According to the lawsuit, the actions of the officers prove that they are 'rogue' and should be disciplined and closely monitored. The complaint also states that, although the officers were placed on administrative leave following the shooting, they were given various maintenance jobs and trained for other positions at the department. The police department have not commented publicly on the matter. Jones’ estate is administered by his brothers, Robert L. Jones and Bruce A. Jones of Winchester, Virginia. A jury trial is set for October 28, 2014. Jones' brothers had battled the state medical examiner’s office for a copy of the autopsy, which the office initially declined to provide because it involved a homicide.

88,"Luftwaffe pilot Oberleutnant Horst von der Groeben was killed when his bomber crashed into the shore near Whitstable . A campaign has been launched to move the bodies of two Luftwaffe pilots to a German war cemetery after their single, unmarked grave was discovered 72 years on. The airmen were buried in the same grave in a Kent churchyard after their two bombers were shot down during a raid on London in August 1940. Three days later another German bomber crashed in the area, resulting in the remains of four men to be buried in one coffin on top of the other two men. More than 20 years later the German . War Graves Service had the remains of all its servicemen killed in . Britain in World War Two exhumed, and interred at the Cannock Chase . German Military Cemetery, in Staffordshire. But the two airmen - Oberleutnant . Horst von der Groeben and Oberleutnant Gerhard Muller - were left behind . as it was not realised their coffins lay underneath the top one. They have remained in the unmarked grave in Whitstable cemetery ever since. Two local historians have now . unravelled the macabre mystery and have identified the unknown airmen . through their identity disc numbers. After realising their names were not . on the Cannock Chase Memorial, Joe Potter and Andy Saunders researched . local records and archives and were able to pinpoint them to 'War Grave . Number 1' at Whitstable. Now the family of Oblt von der . Groeben, the two historians and the Whitstable Royal British Legion are . calling on the authorities to move the bodies to Cannock Chase. Mr Potter said: 'It is a rather bizarre and macabre mystery. 'In 1962 the exhumation team did not realise the graves of another two men lay underneath. 'Although the local records, which . still exist today, show 11 German airmen were buried at Whitstable in . August 1940, only nine were relocated to Cannock. 'Whitstable council should have informed the Germans about the burials of these two men after the war but didn't. 'As a result the two men have . remained forgotten and unidentified in a scruffy grave that is just a . patch of grass with no headstone on. Von der Groeben and his fellow airman Gerhard Muller were buried in this plot at a churchyard in . Whitstable,  but the coffins of other German servicemen were placed on top so when the bodies were exhumed 20 years later they were left behind . 'While . there is an argument for letting the men rest in peace where they were . originally buried it would be fitting for them to join their fallen . comrades at Cannock and be added to the official roll of honour there. 'But it is down to the German War Graves Service to organise and finance.'Historian and author Mr Saunders said: 'I researched this story, with Joe Potter, for my book 'Finding The Foe'. 'I . would be happy to kick-start a fund to help get these men properly . buried under named headstones at the German Military Cemetery.' Horst von Weitershausen, the nephew . of Oblt von der Groeben, said: 'Myself and my two brothers want to move . his grave from Whitstable to Cannock.' In August 1940, Britain faced the real prospect of invasion from the Nazis. During . the height of the Battle of Britain Hitler sent wave and wave of . bombers to attack strategic military targets across south east of . England. On . August 13 a squadron of Dornier 17 bombers found themselves on a doomed . raid as a communication error meant they had no fighter escorts. Downed: The wreckage of Oberleutnant Horst von der Groeben's crashed bomber on Whitstable beach after it was shot down during a raid on London in August 1940 . Blitz raid: The airmen's Dornier 17 bomber was one of five shot down by RAF Hurricanes on August 13, 1940 . Oberleutnant Gerhard Muller's body is carried away from the mudflats . near Seasalter, Whitstable. He had bailed out but was killed after his . parachute failed to open . After bombing coastal targets the planes came under fierce attack by RAF Hurricanes, resulting in five of them being shot down. Oblt Muller was killed after he bailed out of his plane over Seasalter, near Whitstable, and his parachute failed to open. The body of Oblt von der Groeben was washed up at Whitstable after his crashed on the shoreline there. From their identity numbers, they were recorded as being buried at Whitstable on August 17 in the deep grave. The Whitstable branch of the Royal British Legion is in contact with the German embassy in London with a view of getting the process of relocation started. It is thought a fee of about 3,000 pounds will be required to cover the cost of the exhumation and reburial.","Oberleutnant Horst von der Groeben and Oberleutnant Gerhard Muller were buried in the same grave in a Kent churchyard after their two bombers were shot down during a raid on London in August 1940.

89,"A heartbroken dog whose owner died two months ago is missing her so much he is attending services at the Italian church where her funeral was held patiently waiting for her to return. Loyal Tommy, a seven-year-old German Shepherd, belonged to Maria Margherita Lochi, 57, and had been her faithful companion after she adopted him when she found him abandoned in fields close to her home. Mrs Lochi adopted several strays she found but friends said she developed a particular close affection for Tommy and would walk to church with him from her home every day - where the priest would allow him to sit patiently by her feet. Pining: Tommy the German Shepherd waits faithfully during Mass at the church where his owner Maria Margherita Lochi's funeral was held . Following her death at San Donaci near Brindisi, a funeral service was held at which Tommy joined mourners and since then he has been a regular at the church arriving on time when the bells ring out to mark the start of services. Father Donato Panna said:''He's there every time I celebrate Mass and is very well behaved - he doesn't make a sound, I've not heard one bark from him in all the time he has been coming in. 'He used to come to Mass with Maria and he was obviously devoted to her - I let him stay inside as he was always so well behaved and none of the other parishoners ever complained to me. 'He's still coming to Mass even after Maria's funeral, he waits patiently by the side of the altar and just sits there quietly. I didn't have the heart to throw him out - I've just recently lost my own dog so I leave him there until Mass finishes and then I let him out. Sad: Heartbroken Tommy, a seven year old German shepherd, had been adopted by Maria Margherita Lochi, 57, after she found him wandering fields behind her house in San Donaci near Brindisi, Italy . Routine: Tommy and Maria would walk to church together every day - where the priest would allow him to sit patiently by her feet . 'Tommy's been adopted by everyone in the village now and he is everybody's friend. Everyone looks out for him and leaves food for him - although it would be nice to find a proper home for him.' The story of Tommy is similar to the 2009 Hollywood blockbuster Hachi starring Richard Gere which told of how a faithful Akita dog waits patiently for his master after he also dies. It was based on the true story of a Japanese Akita called Hachiko, whose owner died in 1925 but for the next nine years he waited patiently at a railway station for his owner from where they regularly caught a train.","Tommy, a seven-year-old German Shepherd, belonged to Maria Margherita Lochi, 57.

90,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will be welcoming their second baby in April 2015, Kensington Palace has confirmed. Kate's pregnancy was announced last month but the due date had not been released until now. In a statement, the palace said the 32-year-old Duchess, who is around fourteen weeks pregnant, continued to suffer from extreme morning sickness but her condition was 'steadily improving'. Scroll down for video . Spring baby: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will be welcoming their second baby in April 2015, Kensington Palace has confirmed . The pregnant Duchess will make her first public appearance on Tuesday where she will join Prince William to officially welcome Singapore's President Tony Tan as he begins a four-day visit to the UK. The royal couple's second baby will be fourth in line to the throne, behind one-year-old Prince George, who was born in July last year. Kate recently took refuge with her parents while she was 'struggling terribly' with her debilitating antenatal sickness. The royal retreated to her family home in Bucklebury, Berkshire, last week with her son, Prince George. Sources said the Duchess 'hasn't been at all well' as she battles hyperemesis gravidarum, which causes severe vomiting in expectant mothers. Illness: Kate, 32, is around fourteen weeks pregnant with her second child, and has taken refuge with her parents and Prince George due to her antenatal sickness . Her mother Carole Middleton has apparently helped to take charge of her recovery and has been researching alternative sickness cures, such as herbal tea, on the internet. And despite the presence of Spanish nanny Maria Borallo, Mrs Middleton has also been taking George off her daughter's hands. She has been seen in local shops with her 15-month-old grandson, prompting one startled assistant to write on Twitter: 'Served Kate Middleton's mum and Prince George today at work. He is gorgeous!' The Duchess says she feels far more relaxed at the Middleton family's £5million Georgian mansion, Bucklebury Manor, than at Kensington Palace. Baby number two: Kate was hospitalised with hyperemesis gravidarum and severe dehydration during her first pregnancy with George . One source told the Mail: 'Kate is feeling so lousy that she just wanted to be with her family and out of public view. 'She is extremely close to Carole, who is very much a hands-on grandmother. Between her and their nanny, Maria, Kate has all the help she needs with George while she is feeling so sick. 'And Bucklebury is somewhere she can just relax and be herself.' The Duchess – who has now returned to London – has not been seen in public since palace officials were forced to announce her pregnancy last month, several weeks earlier than intended due to her sickness. Kate was hospitalised with hyperemesis gravidarum and severe dehydration during her first pregnancy with George. But doctors have been better prepared this time and may, some medical experts have suggested, even have treated her with a drip at home. A source added: 'Don't be fooled by the fact that she hasn't been admitted to hospital this time. She is just as poorly. The difference is that her doctors have been able to diagnose and treat her quicker. She really hasn't been at all well, though.' The Duchess was forced to cancel her first solo overseas visit – a trip to Malta – last month because of the severity of her condition. Last fortnight she also reluctantly cancelled a visit to a project by The Art Room in London and several other forthcoming engagements have now been scratched out of her diary. Caitlin Dean, of the charity Pregnancy Sickness Support, said: 'Hyperemesis gravidarum is not morning sickness. It is a chronic and debilitating condition that can cause sufferers to vomit up to 30 times a day.' Hyperemesis gravidarum affects about 15 per cent of all pregnancies. The condition is thought to be caused by elevated levels of ‘pregnancy hormone’ HCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin, which increases after conception. It causes severe vomiting and can lead to dehydration, weight loss and a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine, called ketosis. It is much more serious than the nausea commonly experienced by expectant mothers. The severe dehydration puts both mother and baby at risk of being deprived of essential nutrients and sufferers can be left vomiting up to 30 times a day, with exhausting and hazardous consequences. They cannot eat or drink without retching and may lose up to 10 per cent of their body weight when they are supposed to be gaining about 1lb a week. It can trigger a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine known as ketosis as the body tries to compensate for lack of food. Hyperemesis sufferers can also experience acid reflux, where stomach acid keeps repeating up the throat. Hospital treatment for these women is essential, as without intravenous feeding and fluids they are at risk of becoming dangerously dehydrated. Treatment typically includes an injection of the drug heparin to protect against blood clots triggered by dehydration, as well as supplementation of vitamin B, one of the vitamins most depleted by the condition. An intravenous infusion of saline for rehydration is standard practice. The condition can also affect the baby’s development and there is a risk it will be premature or have a very low birth weight. In severe cases, the sickness can trigger a miscarriage.","Kate's pregnancy was announced last month but the due date had not been released until now.

91,"What do Barack Obama, Thomas Jefferson, George W. Bush and the other past U.S. presidents have in common? Besides holding the coveted title of commander-in-chief, it appears that all of them but one are cousins. The remarkable discovery was made by 12-year-old BridgeAnne d’Avignon, of Salinas, California, who created a ground-breaking family tree that connected 42 of 43 U.S. presidents to one common, and rather unexpected, ancestor: King John of England. ‘They all have the trait of wanting power,’ d’Avignon told the station WFMY. Budding genealogist: BridgeAnne d'Avignon created a family tree that connected 42 of 43 U.S. presidents to one common ancestor . History detective: It took d'Avignon several months to search through more than 500,000 names and trace the male and female lineages of American leaders . King John, also known as John ‘Lackland’, is renowned for signing the Magna Carta in 1215, which limited the monarch’s power and helped form the British Parliament. John’s other claim to fame, or infamy, is that he was depicted as the villain in the Robin Hood tales. Common grandfather: The 12-year-old traced the lineages of nearly all of the U.S. presidents to King John, the signer of the Magna Carta . D’Avignon, a seventh-grader at Monte Vista Christian School in Watsonville, started the project in hopes of tracing back her own bloodline in France, but somewhere along the way she decided to take her genealogical quest to the highest level. In order to create the family tree, the 12-year-old spent months scouring through over 500,000 names in search of the ‘presidential Adam.’ Her 80-year-old grandfather, who has been tracing roots for nearly six decades, helped her make the presidential links. D’Avignon started with the first U.S. president, George Washington, she traced both the male and female family lines to make the connection. Prior to d’Avignon’s discovery, genealogists were only able to link 22 families of presidents, likely because they only focused on male bloodlines. The only former commander-in-chief not linked to King John is the eighth president, Martin Van Buren, who had Dutch roots. The teen also found out that she is the . 18th cousin of President Obama. She even wrote to her new-found relative . a letter to share her findings with him. So far, however, d’Avignon said she received only a generic response from the White House. Odd man out: Only the eighth president of the U.S., Martin Van Buren, was not related to King John because he had Dutch roots . D’Avignon created a poster of the presidential family tree and is selling signed copies of it in hopes of raising enough money to make a trip to Washington DC. The middle-school student says her goal is to hand-deliver a replica of her family tree to the president. 'I think we just all go back somewhere; it’s just a matter of proving it,' she said.

92,"Palmer United Party Senator Jacqui Lambie has proposed 'M.A.S.H-style' units to fight the Ebola threat, despite specialised medical response teams already existing in Australia, saying that the Federal government has not responded appropriately to the outbreak. Senator Lambie has announced a five point 'action plan' to fight the deadly virus, which has killed thousands in Africa and has started infiltrating Western countries, 'in order to restore confidence and public trust' in the government. 'Mr Abbott has bungled the response to the Ebola threat from the start and is guilty of being complacent,' said Senator Lambie. 'If any public hysteria or panic develops, it will be because the average Australian has found that the Abbott government has been untrustworthy and dysfunctional in their management of this serious and unprecedented threat to our public health.' Scroll down for video . Senator Lambie has called for MASH style units to fight the Ebola threat . The Ebola virus could infect 10,000 people a week by the end of the year, according to the World Health Organisation . The American TV show series M*A*S*H popularised the work of Mobile Army Surgical Hospital workers . The plan includes making travel to and from all African countries illegal, and boosting custom's resources to install thermal imaging at airports to ensure that all overseas arrivals are scanned for symptoms of Ebola. The points also include establishing quarantine facilities and dedicated Ebola treatment areas, and establishing a medical research unit for Ebola and other deadly diseases to engage in and contribute to world research. The outspoken Tasmanian senator has further proposed establishing specialist medical teams in conjunction with the Australian Defense Force capable of domestic and international deployment, which she said will be 'similar in organisational structure to MASH teams of Vietnam era'. These suggestions have been deemed unfounded by a senior doctor, who notes that such teams already exist in Australia. Dr Steve Parnis, the Vice President of the Australian Medical Association, told Daily Mail Australia there was no need for them to be implemented. 'We have those teams. They're called AUSMAT teams,' he said. 'These are civilian teams, doctors, nurses, people with logistical expertise. 'The question is whether the existing services will be deployed by government and whether they have the manpower.' The work of Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals were popularised in the early 1970's by the airing of US television series M*A*S*H, which ran for 11 years. The series, though set during the Korean War, commented on conditions and actions from the Korean War and while often viewed as an unconventional sitcom, often raised the role of the US as both war-maker and peacemaker. The show centered around the work of Hawkeye (Alan Alder), Father Mulcahy (William Christopher), Margaret 'Hot Lips' Houlihan (Loretta Swit), and Maxwell Q. Klinger (Jamie Farr). Australia's equivalent to the Mobile Hospitals,AUSMAT, is based in Darwin and consists of doctors, nurses, firefighters and allied health staff. AUSMAT teams have been involved in responding to many natural disasters and international crisis,  including deployment to the Philippines when Typhoon Haiyan struck in November 2013. 'There's certainly no need to set up anything new,' Dr Parnis said, adding that Australia has good public health resources. A spokesman for Senator Lambie disagreed, saying there was a need for a specific Ebola unit for volunteer medical professionals. Senator Lambie is one of the most outspoken new senators . Alan Alda and others were stars of M*A*S*H, the program which made popular the work of mobile surgical hospital workers during the Korean War . 'You don't want to degrade the other resources you have for natural disasters, because obviously, these are going to have to be specialist teams,' he said. Health Minister Peter Dutton tried to tamp down fears Ebola would reach Australia on Friday, saying the nation remains at very low risk. Earlier this week the World Health Organisation warned infections from the deadly virus could hit 10,000 infections a week by the end of the year. The ABC reported the government has been screening passengers from West Africa since August. Senator Lambie's plan also proposed banning travel from Ebola-stricken countries and for thermal imaging to be installed at airports.","Senator Jacqui Lambie has proposed 'M.A.S.H-style' units to fight the Ebola threat.

93,"'When we hear the term missing . persons, most people conjure up images of Chandra Levy, Caylee Anthony . or Natalee Holloway,' says charity . 40 per cent of all missing persons are black . A renewed campaign to highlight hundreds of missing African-American women has been launched amid ongoing criticism that less attention is given to their cases by authorities and the media. According to the National Crime Information Center, nearly 40 per cent . of those who have disappeared, often in suspicious circumstances, are black. However critics allege that public . attention mainly focuses on white women who have vanished. According to the Black And Missing Foundation, most women disappear in the states of New York, Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland and Florida. Vanished: Phoenix Coldon, 23, of St Louis (left) disappeared on December 18 while Stacey English (right) was last seen on Christmas Day. Both women's cars were found with the engine running . A total of 273,985 minorities . were reported missing in the United . States (out of 692,944 for all . races) as of December 2010. The foundation has . teamed up with a TV network to make a series, Find Our Missing, telling the stories behind the women's disappearances. The non-profit organization was formed in 2008 to . draw attention to cases and keep pressure on authorities when leads and information dry up. The Black And Missing . Foundation told MailOnline there are a number of reasons as to why the cases of missing . black women are largely forgotten. Firstly, the organisation points out . that there is often a lack of diversity in newsrooms meaning the . African-American community is not properly reflected in coverage. Not forgotten: Ashani Creighton, now 19, (left) was abducted by her grandparents from Orlando in 1998 while Sharaun Cole, now 41, (right) was last seen outside her New York home in 1983 but few details are known about her disappearance. These photos have been doctored to show the ageing process . Another key reason is that missing . persons from a lower economic status are often associated with some sort . of criminal activity. Behind the hundreds of cases are . painful details sketched out by families, left wondering what has become . of their loved ones. Many women have been missing for decades. In two incidents at the end of last . year, a chilling connection was made between two missing women - 500 . miles apart -  discovered in part because of the attention charities . brought to their cases. Phoenix Coldon, 23, of St Louis, Missouri, went missing on December 18 while Stacey English, 36, vanished in Atlanta, Georgia on Christmas Day 2011. Remember me: The FBI's National Centre for Missing Persons reports that almost 40 per cent of those missing are African-American . Startling: A total of 273,985 minorities were reported missing in the United States, according to the FBI in 2010  - this is the percentage breakdown  based on race . The cars of both women were abandoned with the engine running and the keys in the ignition. In both cases the cars were impounded, a fact that police in both cities . did not realize until several days into the investigations. Miss Coldon's mother Goldia Coldon said at the time that the fact both women were African-American had not gone unnoticed. A separate non-profit group, Black And Missing But Not Forgotten had also picked up on the cases. There were other heartbreaking cases where . years have passed without any clues to where the women have gone, . leaving anguished families with little hope of closure. Arnika Miller, now aged 33, disappeared on August 21, 2010 from Topeka, Kansas. Before she went missing, it is alleged that Miss Miller told a co-worker that her boyfriend and his friends had assaulted her and stolen her identification and money and that she was afraid of them. She had duel citizenship with Canada. Her family are deeply concerned for her safety as she is an insulin-dependent diabetic and she may have had a broken leg. Her last sighting was unknown. Asia Nicole Martin, now 26, was last seen on May 27, 2005 in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. She told her roommate that she was going for a walk at 8.40pm and never came home. The student bought a bus ticket to visit her mother in Denver but never boarded it. Her roommate said that she was acting normally when she left, but her family are concerned that something may have happened to her as it was unusual for her not to contact them and she has an unspecified medical condition. Tilawna Cheatham, now 31, disappeared on August 11, 1989 when she was nine years old in Aiken, South Carolina. Her photo has been age progressed to show what she would look like, aged 27. The girl was last seen after she argued with her mother, took spare change from a jar and left home. Two neighbours spotted the girl at 5.30pm at a convenience store a few blocks from her house. Latoria Renae McClarin, 27, went missing on November 1 from Goldsboro, North Carolina. She left her house with a man, identified as Ray, and told her family she would be right back. Ray is believed to be an acquaintance from the city of Wilson in the state but Miss McClarin's family don't know anything else about him. She does not have medication that she needs with her. Ashani . Karin Creighton, who would now be 19, was last seen by her mother in . Orlando, Florida after being initially abducted by her grandparents, Ernest S. Jackson and Kaia Jackson in 1998. It is time for all people - regardless of race - to be treated equally in their times of greatest need. Natalie Wilson, co-founder of the Black And Missing Foundation . The . grandparents were taken into custody in 2000. Miss Creighton is feared dead . but what happened to the teenager is still unknown. In the case of Sharon Davis, now 61, . who has been missing for eleven years, she was last seen at 7am on June . 13 after being dropped off by her daughter in a Dallas parking lot. She had said she was going home to . change her clothes for a meeting but her van was later found abandoned. The vehicle had a broken window and was wiped clean of fingerprints. Her two children alleged that Ms . Davis's husband may know more about her disappearance as she  had filed . for divorce two days before she was last seen. Natalie Wilson, co-founder of the Black And Missing Foundation, told ABC: 'When we hear the term ''missing . persons'', most people conjure up images of Chandra Levy, Caylee Anthony . or Natalee Holloway. 'As a result, the public is misled in . believing that victims of abductions and kidnappings are [all] blonde, . blue-eyed and female.' Still out there? Shandell McLeod (l), 35, was last seen on October 1 in Lithonia, Georgia - her family fear her life is in danger.

They measure around 0.75ins in diameter from the gum line. But the population living in waters around Hawaii has plenty of reason not to be so cheerful, having suffered signifant decline over the past 25 years.

He said: 'The bear was fishing for red salmon in the lake and after eating a substantial dinner decided to have a rest in the sun. 'I think it was at that point that he decided enough was enough. He'd hardly paid any attention to me all day but once he'd exhausted himself and filled his belly I guess he just wanted to relax on his own without me taking pictures.

95,"Sir Cliff Richard pictured in Portugal this summer, the first sighting of him after police raided his home. He is now preparing to sue BBC over its coverage . Sir Cliff Richard is preparing to sue the BBC over its controversial live TV coverage of the police raid on his home. The singer will seek damages for breach of privacy if, as he expects, he is not charged over an allegation of historic sexual abuse. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Sir Cliff is also considering legal action against South Yorkshire Police. The force struck a deal with the Corporation to film the swoop on his £3 million penthouse. In August the BBC faced an avalanche of criticism from leading lawyers, celebrities and politicians after it dispatched a helicopter to hover over the Berkshire property and stationed reporters at its gates before police had even arrived. Cameramen in the air were able to zoom in on officers through the windows as they searched through belongings. Sir Cliff, who vigorously denies any wrongdoing and has not been arrested, was in Portugal at the time. ‘No citizen should have to watch on live television their home being raided in this way,’ concluded a blistering Home Affairs Select Committee report. Sir Cliff’s lawyer Gideon Benaim denounced the ‘premature and disproportionate’ reporting which caused the veteran entertainment ‘immeasurable harm’. Friends say Sir Cliff is now determined to launch a concerted fightback. As his association with the BBC goes back to the start of his career – he appeared on Juke Box Jury in 1961 and on the first episode of Top Of The Pops in 1964 – legal action is likely to cause acute embarrassment. The singer was said to be dismayed to learn of the extent of co-operation between South Yorkshire Police and the BBC in the weeks leading up to the raid. As the Home Affairs Select Committee noted last month, not only did the force give the broadcaster the date of the search, it also ‘handed over a great deal of information freely’. This newspaper can disclose that emails, text messages and other documents given to the committee show that the BBC: . One legal expert said last night that the level of intrusion meant Sir Cliff would have a ‘strong case’ and added that the BBC would struggle to mount a public interest defence. The police investigation began when a man, now in his 40s, came forward earlier this year to claim Sir Cliff sexually assaulted him during a Christian rally in Sheffield organised by Billy Graham, the American evangelist, in 1985. The BBC were able to capture images of police arriving at the property as they received advanced notice of the raid and sent a helicopter to hover overhead, . Hundreds of politicians, celebrities and lawyers complained over the BBC's coverage - which showed police officers going room-to-room (pictured) - saying it made the singer look guilty . The BBC’s Johnson first contacted South Yorkshire Police about the allegation in mid-July and spoke to Carrie Goodwin, head of corporate communications. In a letter, Goodwin recalled that Johnson was able to ‘detail the allegation, accurately and the location the allegation related to. 'Specifically he spoke about a boy aged between 11 and 14 alleging that he had been taken to a room... where he was made to carry out a sexual act.’ A month before the raid, Goodwin sent Johnson an email asking if he would like her to ‘set something up with the officer in the celebrity case’. He replies: ‘That would be fab.’ Notes from the meeting show that Johnson asked if the BBC could accompany officers during the search of Sir Cliff’s home. Unsurprisingly, the request was turned down. However, fearing Johnson was about to break the story prematurely, police felt they had no choice but to deal with him and agreed to give him advance notice of the raid. In fact the head of the investigation, Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick would later say the force had been ‘effectively blackmailed’. Over the next few weeks, dozens of emails and texts were exchanged between the force and the reporter. In one email, on July 18, Johnson asked if the BBC could speak to the alleged victim. He said he was worried the alleged victim might tip off other media about the raid. He asked Goodwin: ‘I don’t know how closely you’re keeping him updated on progress and plans. I wouldn’t want him becoming aware of progress through our interest, prompting him to...alert other media’. BBC reporter David Sillito speaks to camera as cars leave Sir Cliff's house. The BBC coverage of the raid was the first time the musician was aware of the police sting . South Yorkshire Police say they were given no choice but to hand details of the raid to Dan Johnson, for fear that he would reveal the operation ahead of time . Carrie Goodwin, press chief for the force, messaged Mr Johnson a month ahead of the raid asking whether she should ‘set something up with the officer in the celebrity case’. He replied: ‘That would be fab.’ Goodwin responded that the ‘complainant is being kept up to date to an extent but I’ll make the team aware of your concerns’. At this point she warns Johnson that the inquiry isn’t ‘progressing as quickly as thought’ because ‘there doesn’t seem to be a UK address’. It might mean, she adds, that officers will ‘need to go and try one of the foreign ones [Cliff owns homes in Portugal and the Bahamas]. 'We are considering which one would operationally be the better choice.’ Eventually they did find Sir Cliff’s Berkshire address, and tipped off Johnson the night before the raid. Helpfully, one of Goodwin’s team sent the reporter an aerial photograph of the property and said: ‘From what I’ve been told by officers who are down there now there won’t be much to see from the street.’ At 10.20am the following day, with the police poised to swoop on the apartment, Johnson exchanged text messages with a police media officer, Lesley Card. He asked: ‘You parked underground? Helicopter can’t see you’. Card replies: ‘No we’re not parked near the property at this time – while we wait to hear bout entry, we’re parked off in the grounds somewhere.’ Johnson then asks: ‘Have you managed to get in his place?’. He is told: ‘Yes, we have managed to gain entry.’ He later asks: ‘Give me a shout before they take anything out, so we can get the chopper in place for a shot.’ When asked about the legal action, a spokesman for Sir Cliff declined to comment. The singer, who was interviewed under caution by police ten days after the raid, has described the allegation against him as ‘completely false’. He has received huge support from the public and has continued to work. Next September he will embark on his 75th birthday tour, which has just added a sixth date at London’s Royal Albert Hall. ‘I am moved by the support the fans have shown, and am very much looking forward to seeing them on the tour next year,’ he said. After broadcasting live, the BBC received hundreds of complaints from viewers, with many saying that the coverage made the singer look guilty. Keith Vaz MP said the police acted 'entirely properly' in their dealings with the BBC, but that their coverage had caused 'irreparable damage' (pictured, the head of South Yorks Police speaks to MPs over the incident) Yesterday, Jack Good, 83, the TV producer credited with turning Sir Cliff into a star in the late 1950s, called the broadcast ‘shameful’. Sir Michael Parkinson, 79, a former BBC journalist, described it as a ‘witch-hunt’ and attacked the Corporation for an ‘error of judgment’. Former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis said: ‘The decision by the leadership of South Yorkshire police to allow the searching of Sir Cliff Richard’s house to be televised, like some morally challenged reality TV show, demonstrates there is something sick at the heart of Britain’s police and justice system.’ However, Home Affairs Select Committee chairman Keith Vaz said the BBC acted ‘perfectly properly’ in its dealings with police over the raid, but the coverage had caused Sir Cliff ‘enormous, irreparable damage’. Last night the BBC said the Home Affairs Committee ‘has already endorsed the way the BBC handled this story. We have nothing further to add’. South Yorkshire Police said: ‘While we believe our actions in relation to dealing with the media were within policy and were well-intended, they were ultimately flawed and we regret the additional anxiety which was caused to Sir Cliff Richard.’ It said it ‘no longer provides privileged briefings to reporters’.","Sir Cliff Richard is preparing to sue BBC over its coverage of police raid.

But thanks to the popularity of e-readers, it seems that when you settle down to enjoy a novel you’re no longer alone.

Invasion of privacy: Renate Samson, of the privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘It is rather alarming to think that whilst you read your e-book your e-reader device is reading you' At the moment e-books account for around a fifth of all book sales in the UK, across all age groups. Many older readers have adopted the gadgets because they can easily increase the font size, making books easier to read without having to pay for a special large-print edition. Mr Tamblyn said that it was collecting data to help it increase the e-book market. ‘What we’re interested in is where does the next 20 per cent come from? We think it will be people who are holding onto print much more tightly than in the past,’ he said.","Kobo supplies e-readers to WHSmith, John Lewis and Tesco.

99,"Enemy No 1: Internal emails released by the Defense Department show that no U.S. sailors witnessed Osama bin Laden's burial at sea aboard USS Carl Vinson . Internal emails among U.S. military officers indicate that no American sailors watched Osama bin Laden's burial at sea from the USS Carl Vinson, and traditional Islamic procedures were followed during the secret ceremony. The emails, obtained by The Associated Press through the Freedom of Information Act, are heavily blacked out, but are the first public disclosure of government information about the al-Qaida leader's death. The emails were released Wednesday by the Defense Department. Bin Laden was killed on May 1, 2011, by a Navy SEAL team that assaulted his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. One email stamped secret and sent on May 2 by a senior Navy officer briefly describes how bin Laden's body was washed, wrapped in a white sheet, and then placed in a weighted bag. According to another message from the Vinson's public affairs officer, only a small group of the ship's leadership was informed of the burial. ‘Traditional procedures for Islamic burial was followed,’ the May 2 email from Rear Adm. Charles Gaouette reads. ‘The deceased's body was washed (ablution) then placed in a white sheet. The body was placed in a weighted bag. ‘A military officer read prepared religious remarks, which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker. After the words were complete, the body was placed on a prepared flat board, tipped up, whereupon the deceased's body slid into the sea.’ Final destination: Bin Laden's body was taken to an unknown location aboard USS Carl Vinson and dropped into the sea, but the Defense Department says that it cannot find any images showing the terrorist mastermind's remains on the ship . Fallen mastermind: In this undated file image from video seized from bin Laden's walled compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, the al Qaeda leader watches TV . Stronghold: Members of the anti-terrorism squad are seen surrounding the compound where bin Laden was killed by Navy SEAL Team 6 in Abbottabad May 4, 2011 . The email also included a cryptic reference to the intense secrecy surrounding the mission. ‘The . paucity of documentary evidence in our possession is a reflection of . the emphasis placed on operational security during the execution of this . phase of the operation,’ Gaouette's message reads. Long-awaited news: U.S. President Barack Obama is pictured after announcing live on television the death of Osama bin Laden from the East Room of the White House in Washington May 1, 2011 . Recipients . of the email included Adm. Mike Mullen, then the chairman of the Joint . Chiefs of Staff, and Gen. James Mattis, the top officer at U.S. Central . Command. Mullen retired from the military in September 2011. Earlier, . Gaouette, then the deputy commander of the Navy's Fifth Fleet, and . another officer used code words to discuss whether the helicopters . carrying the SEALs and bin Laden's body had arrived on the Vinson. ‘Any . news on the package for us?’ he asked Rear Adm. Samuel Perez, commander . of the carrier strike group that included the Vinson. ‘FEDEX delivered the package,’ Perez responded. ‘Both trucks are safely enroute home base.’ Although . the Obama administration has pledged to be the most transparent in . American history, it is keeping a tight hold on materials related to the . bin Laden raid. In a response to separate requests . from the AP for information about the mission, the Defense Department . said in March that it could not locate any photographs or video taken . during the raid or showing bin Laden's body. It also said it could not . find any images of bin Laden's body on the Vinson. The Pentagon also said it could not . find any death certificate, autopsy report or results of DNA . identification tests for bin Laden, or any pre-raid materials discussing . how the government planned to dispose of bin Laden's body if he were . killed. Historic moment: In this May 1, 2011, image, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden receive an update on the bin Laden mission in the Situation Room . The Defense Department also refused to confirm or deny the existence of helicopter maintenance logs and reports about the performance of military gear used in the raid. One of the stealth helicopters that carried the SEALs to Abbottabad crashed during the mission and its wreckage was left behind. People who lived near bin Laden's compound took photos of the disabled chopper. The CIA, which ran the bin Laden raid and has special legal authority to keep information from ever being made public, has not responded to AP's request for records about the mission.","Internal emails among U.S. military officers indicate that no American sailors watched Osama bin Laden's burial at sea from the USS Carl Vinson.
